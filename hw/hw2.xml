  <text>Write a program to print the first 15 Fibonacci numbers. Start
  with 0 and 1 as the first two numbers. The next number is created by
  adding the previous two numbers. Thus, the third number is the sum
  of the first two: 0 + 1 = 1.  Then the fourth is the sum of the
  second and third: 1 + 1 = 2.  The fifth is then 1 + 2 = 3, and so
  on.</text>

  <text>Say you wanted to print out the Celsius equivalent for all
  integer Fahrenheit temperatures from -50 degrees F to 50 degrees
  F. Write a program to print out this conversion information using
  the equation for converting Fahrenheit (F) to Celsius (C):
  <pre>C = (F-32)*5/9</pre>
  
  Pseudocode for implementing this is given below:

  <ol>
    <li>Set F's initial value to -50</li>
    <li>While F is less than or equal to 50, do the following:
    <ol>
      <li>Convert Fahrenheit to Celsius.</li>
      <li>If Fahrenheit and Celsius are equal:
      <ol><li>print "Fahrenheit and Celsius are equal at -40 degrees!"</li></ol>
      Else
      <ol><li>print the number of degrees in Fahrenheit followed by the
      number of degrees in Celsius. This should be printed using the
      line

      <pre>print("F=" + F + ", " + "C=" + C)</pre></li></ol>
      </li>
      <li>Increment F</li>
    </ol>
