	  Where are we now?</div><p>In the previous chapter, we described a computer's
      interface--the ISA-- and specifically the computer's
      architecture (what various memories it has) and its instructions
      (what it can do to that architecture).  But a computer is still
      supposed to be a physical machine!  And so far, we've only
      learned (chapter 4) how physical machines can store numbers, and
      not how they can store these instructions.  For that matter,
      we've talked about computers as storing much more than just
      numbers--a search engine stores text and a game console stores
      images.</p><p>In this chapter, we shall bridge this final gap by
      demonstrating that all these things: instructions, images,
      graphics, and anything else we want to store, can be stored just
      using numbers.  <span id="def_encoding" class="definition"></span>A mechanism for storing
      numbers that correspond to a given kind of data is called an
      <b>encoding</b> for that data.</p></div></div><div class="section"><div id="sec_6_2"></div><div class="text"><div class="header">6.2: 
	  Generalities about encodings</div><p><span id="def_decodable" class="definition"></span>There is essentially only one hard and
      fast rule governing what constitutes a valid encoding: It must
      be <b>unambiguous</b> or <b>decodable</b>. That is, if we
      tell someone our encoding scheme for some set of objects
      (characters, instructions, whatever), and then we present them
      with a list of bytes that encodes some of these objects using
      that scheme, they should be able to use the scheme to determine
      without ambiguity what objects we have encoded.</p><p>As long as the encoding can actually be successfully decoded,
      anything else is a bonus.  <span id="def_efficient (encoding)" class="definition"></span>For
      example, some encodings are more <b>efficient</b> than others in
      that they usually require fewer bytes to encode the same
      data.</p><p><span id="def_error-resistant" class="definition"></span>As another example, some
      encodings can be more <b>error-resistant</b> than others.  This
      refers to what happens if we see a sequence of bytes encoding
      some objects, but one or more of the bytes has been modified
      accidentally.  An error-resistant encoding will allow us to
      still determine what objects were originally intended, or at
      least will lead us to an answer that isn't so far off what was
      intended.  A less error-resistant encoding may have its
      interpretation change dramatically with even just a small change
      in the bytes representing it.
      </p><p>There are many other considerations that may apply depending
      on how your encoding will be deployed.  Some encoding schemes
      may rely on actually being completely undecodable unless the
      person decoding them has some extra secret information (such as
      a password).  These are usually called "encryption schemes".</p><div class="aside"><b>Aside: Encodings in history</b>
	<p>Nowadays, we regularly send encoded text over very large
	distances without a second thought.  This text is usually
	encoded as numbers simply because most of the infrastructure
	we have, from hard drives to cellular towers to undersea fiber
	optic cables, is built solely to store and transmit numbers
	efficiently.  </p>

	<p>In a time when this infrastructure didn't exist,
	communicating data across large distances was often a massive
	undertaking, and being able to do this quickly could have
	dramatic monetary or strategic consequences.  Text was still
	encoded for communication, not as numbers (since the
	number-moving infrastructure wasn't in place yet) but in
	various other ways that were adapted to the infrastructure
	that did exist at the time.  </p>

	<p>One such encoding was called "semaphore", which involved a
	signaler standing someplace visible to the recipient and
	holding out flags in various configurations representing
	letters of the alphabet.  If the recipient were too far away
	to see the sender, there would have to be intermediate
	signalers to relay the original message.  Sometimes, there
	were many relayers in a very long line.  In 18th century
	France, relay towers were built with larger, more visible
	mechanical arms.  They were constructed along lines that
	spanned the whole width of the country, such that a commander
	in Paris could receive news from Strasbourg in the far
	north-east in just six minutes.  Napoleon Bonaparte even had
	such a line constructed from Paris all the way to Venice.</p>
	
	<p>Another encoding that surfaced when electric lines started
	to criss-cross whole countries (but did not yet carry digital
	information) was Morse code.  One could connect an electrical
	line to a buzzer, and as the sender on the other end connected
	and disconnected the line with a button, the receiver could
	listen to the buzzer and denote the short buzzes as dots, the
	long buzzes as dashes, and longer pauses between buzzes as
	separating the different letters.  Morse code was a system for
	corresponding sequences of dots and dashes to letters.  In
	this encoding, "-..-" (heard as "beeeeeeep beep beep
	beeeeeeep") would have represented "X", whereas "." would have
	represented "E".  This represented an early understanding of
	efficiency in encodings: "E" is a much more common letter than
	X, so it is more efficient to have it correspond to a simpler
	sequence.</p>

      </div></div></div><div class="section"><div id="sec_6_2_1"></div><div class="text"><div class="header">6.2.1: 
	  Enumeration as encoding</div><p><span id="def_enumeration (encoding)" class="definition"></span>Before we get into any
	specific encodings, we present the most basic strategy of all
	for encoding: Enumeration. To illustrate this strategy,
	we return to our waffle bakery example:</p><p>We're designing a computer program for the bakery.  We want
	to represent the different waffle offerings they have using
	numbers.  So we make a list of all the waffle offerings
	(starting from 0 like good computer programmers): </p><div class="code"><pre>
	  0. Donut waffle
	  1. Plain waffle
	  2. Blueberry waffle
	  3. Belgian waffle
	  4. Whole-grain waffle
	  5. Chocowaffle
	  6. Catnip waffle
	  ...
	</pre></div><p>And then we realize that this numbered list actually is an
	encoding already--Blueberry waffles correspond to the number
	2, chocolate to the number 5, and so on!  So when the user
	selects "Catnip waffle" on the website, the website the number
	6 to the server and the server takes recipe number 6 and sends
	it to the kitchen for preparation, which is of course the
	recipe for a catnip waffle.</p><p>This encoding is of course decodable: If we give someone
	the sequence of bytes 4, 1, 3 then they can easily decode this
	as "A whole-grain, a plain, and a Belgian".  But what happens
	if the chef gets really creative and comes up with 300
	recipes?  </p><div class="code"><pre>
	  0. Donut waffle
	  1. Plain waffle
	  2. Blueberry waffle
	  3. Belgian waffle
	  4. Whole-grain waffle
	  5. Chocowaffle
	  6. Catnip waffle
	  ...
	  259. Stroopwafel
	  260. Maple bacon waffle
	  261. Sunny-side up waffle
	  ...
	  297. Upside-down waffle
	  298. Inside-out waffle
	  299. Waffle waffle
	</pre></div><p>Now suddenly some of the numbers are too big for a byte
	(remember bytes can only store 8 bits, or numbers 0-255).  "No
	problem", we think.  "we'll just use two bytes for the bigger
	ones using concatenation".  Since 259 = 1*256 + 3 = 1:3, we
	can store the number 259 using the two bytes 1, 3.  But now we
	have a decodability problem: What if we get the sequence of
	bytes 4, 1, 3.  Does this mean "Whole-grain, plain, and
	Belgian" or "Whole-grain and Stroopwafel"?  </p><p>So if we're going to use two bytes to encode some of the
	waffles, we'd have to use two bytes to encode all of them.
	Thus an order of "Plain, Stroopwafel, and Donut waffle" would
	be encoded as 0, 1, 1, 3, 0, 0 (since Plain = 1 = 0:1,
	Stroopwafel = 259 = 1:3, and Donut waffle = 0 = 0:0).  </p><p>So enumeration encodings can essentially always be used to
	encode any finite list of objects as long as sufficient care
	is given to ensure decodeability.</p></div></div><div class="section"><div id="sec_6_3"></div><div class="text"><div class="header">6.3: 
	  Encoding of instructions</div><p>Our first example of an encoding is ISA instructions.  Recall
      that the way the processor is set up, there is a memory for
      storing instructions--the program memory--which has width 16,
      meaning it can only store words (numbers 0-65535).  Somehow, we
      can store some numbers in this memory to cause the program

<div class="code"><pre>ldi r30,89
andi r30,6</pre></div>

      to be executed.</p><p>For the sake of example, let us look at one hypothetical way
      that one could encode instructions:</p></div></div><div class="section"><div id="sec_6_3_1"></div><div class="text"><div class="header">6.3.1: 
	  An enumeration-based instruction encoding</div><p>One very naive way to encode instructions is to simply
	enumerate them.  In the previous chapter, we provided a list
	of all possible instruction types--ldi, add, rcall, etc.
	However each instruction could only take finitely many
	possible operands, so we can in fact enumerate all the
	possible instructions one could ever write in a (very long)
	finite list.  For instance, all the possible incarnations of
	ldi instructions are:

<div class="code"><pre>ldi r16,0
ldi r16,1
...
ldi r16,255
...
ldi r31,255</pre></div>

        There are 256 instructions of the form ldi r16,[something],
        and 16 different registers we can load a value into (recall
        ldi doesn't let you load into registers 0-15), for a total of
        4096 different instructions.  For an encoding, we could just
        make them correspond to the numbers 0-4095 respectively.  Thus
        ldi r16,0 will be encoded with the number 0, ldi r16,1 with
        the number 1, ldi r17,0 with the number 256, and ldi r30,89
        with the number 3673, etc.</p><p>Then we have the andi instructions

<div class="code"><pre>andi r0,0
...
andi r0,255
andi r1,0
...
andi r1,255
......
andi r31,255</pre></div>

        This is another 8192 instructions.  We've already assigned
        the numbers 0-4095 to correspond to the ldi instructions, so
        we may as well take the next 8192 numbers--that is,
        4096-12287--and make these correspond to the andi instructions
        in the above order.  In the above list of andi instructions,
        andi r30,6 will be the 7687th andi instruction, so it will be
        assigned the number 11783 under this encoding scheme.</p><p>Thus, if we used the naive encoding above, then our program
	would be stored as the two numbers 3673 and 11783.  Or, in
	binary:

<div class="code"><pre>0000111001011001
0010111000000111</pre></div>

as 3673 is the encoded version of ldi r30,89 and 11783 is the encoding
of andi r30,6.  </p><p>For all we know so far, this encoding might be as good as any
other--for instance, we chose to start with the ldi and andi
instructions, but maybe we could instead encode the ldi instructions
using the first 4096 numbers, and then encode the mov instructions
using the next 1024 numbers (1024 being the number of different
possible mov instructions).</p><p>But to see if we can be more systematic about it, let us see what
this encoding actually means on the level of the binary
representations.  Under this suggested scheme, we'll have encodings:</p><p>
<table><tr><td>Instruction</td><td>Decimal</td><td>16-bit binary</td></tr>

</table>
</p><p>A couple of things we notice from these examples: out of our 16
bits, the low 8 bits are just the binary representation of the value
that should be loaded.  For instance, if we want to load the value 60
into some register, I take 60 as an 8-bit binary number: 00111100, and
place that into the lower 8 bits of the instruction.  Observe that ldi
r16,60 was

<div class="code"><pre>00000000<b>00111100</b></pre></div>

whereas ldi r31,60 was

<div class="code"><pre>00001111<b>00111100</b></pre></div>

Then the next-lowest 4 bits tell us which register we're loading from: To store the value 145 (binary 10010001) into register 16, we do

<div class="code"><pre>0000<b>0000</b>10010001</pre></div>

whereas to store 145 into r26, we do

<div class="code"><pre>0000<b>1010</b>10010001</pre></div>

and into r31 would be

<div class="code"><pre>0000<b>1111</b>10010001</pre></div>

Observe that these four bits aren't literally the binary
representation of the register number to be loaded:</p><p><table><tr><td>To load to register number </td><td>(in binary)</td><td>Set bits 9-13 to: </td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>10000</td><td>0000</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>11010</td><td>1010</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td><td>11111</td><td>1111</td></tr>
</table></p><p>Since the bits that select which register we load into only have to
select between 16 different possibilities (registers 16-31) we only
need 4 bits to represent this choice.  And if those four bits are,
say, 1010, we see that we can get the actual register number being
selected by just throwing a 1 on the front of it, giving 11010,
i.e. 26.  </p><p>So fundamentally, to specify an ldi instruction, we need to use 4
bits for the register selection, and 8 bits for the immediate value
that we wish to load.  Our naive encoding said that for ldi, we use
the lowest 8 bits for the immediate value and the next 4 bits for the
register select.  We shall denote this encoding in the following
concise notation:

<div class="code"><pre>ldi: 0000RRRRIIIIIIII loads binary value IIIIIIII into register 1RRRR</pre></div>

What this means is that the bits labeled I comprise the binary value
to be loaded, and the bits labeled R comprise the last four bits of
the register select, with the first bit of the register select being
always 1.  For example, if we get the instruction 0000101000011110, we
can decode it thus:</p><div class="figure"><img src="/text/figures/6.3.1.fig1.png" width="500px"><div class="caption">Figure 6.3.1.1: Decoding 0000101000011110
as ldi r26, 30</div></div></div></div><div class="section"><div id="sec_6_3_2"></div><div class="text"><div class="header">6.3.2: 
	  The AVR ISA encoding</div><p>But now that we understand what's really required to choose
	a representation for ldi instructions--we need to reserve one
	4-bit blob and one 8-bit blob in the instruction for the
	operands--we can do whatever we like.  For instance, we could
	swap the order in which we did the above:

	<div class="code"><pre><b>ldi</b>: 0000IIIIIIIIRRRR loads binary value IIIIIIII into register 1RRRR</pre></div>

	And this might be an equally good choice.  So rather than
	choosing an encoding by trying to enumerate all the
	instructions and assign them numbers sequentially, we can be
	more systematic by looking at all the types of instructions
	(mov, ldi, andi, etc.) and boil them down to exactly what
	information they require.  For example, we just saw that ldi
	fundamentally requires only one 4-bit number and one 8-bit
	number.</p><p>By contrast mov requires us to specify two registers--that
	is, two numbers 0-31.  And in binary, it takes 5 bits to
	represent a number 0-31.  So the basic information built into
	a mov instruction is two 5-bit numbers.  So we could encode
	mov instructions as:

	<div class="code"><pre><b>mov</b>: 000000RRRRRSSSSS moves value of register SSSSS into register RRRRR</pre></div>

	Thus the instruction 

	<div class="code"><pre>0000000011011110</pre></div>

	would have RRRRR being 00110 and SSSSS being 11110.  In
	particular, this would put whatever was stored in register 30
	into register 6.</p><p>But not so fast!  Back when we were using the enumeration
	encoding, we were guaranteed decodability, since every
	instruction was two bytes long.  But now that we've ventured
	out on our own, we need to be careful.  We intended this word
	to represent a mov, but as we've encoded it, this could also
	be interpreted as the instruction ldi r16,222, (as 1RRRR is
	10000 (decimal: 16) and IIIIIIII is 11011110 (decimal:
	222)).</p><p>To resolve this particular ambiguity, we can take advantage
	of the bits that are not storing actual information used by
	the instruction--those zeroes out in front.  In our ldi
	encoding, these are the first 4 bits, whereas in mov, this is
	the first 6.  So if we instead use:

	<div class="code"><pre><b>ldi</b>: 0000IIIIIIIIRRRR loads binary value IIIIIIII into register 1RRRR
mov: 000100RRRRRSSSSS moves value of register SSSSS into register RRRRR</pre></div>

	Now we can always tell which instruction was intended by
	looking at the first four bits.  If we see 0001, it was a mov,
	and if we see 0000, it was an ldi.  </p><p>Now we have all the background necessary to understand the
	encoding used by actual AVR chips for the AVR ISA.  We'll
	start by listing the types of instruction and what information
	they fundamentally require:</p><p><table>

</table></p><p>We just need to take each of these types and specify which bits of
the encoding are used for which operands in each of them.  For
instance, the AVR encoding for the first type of instruction is
defined by the following arrangement:

<div class="code"><pre>CCCCIIIIRRRRIIII</pre></div>

This means we use the lowest 4 bits for the low 4 bits of the
immediate operand, the next 4 bits for the register, and then the next
4 bits for the high 4 bits of the immediate.  This leaves us with 4
additional bits which we have marked as C.  </p><p><span id="def_opcode" class="definition"></span>Note that we have four different instructions
that take a 4-bit register and an 8-bit immediate.  The C bits are
used to distinguish between these.  For instance, for any ldi
instruction, the C bits are always set to 1110.  This set of bits,
which specifies not the operand, but rather which type of instruction
is being run, is called the <b>opcode</b>. </p><p>Thus if we receive the instruction

<div class="code"><pre>1110101000101110</pre></div>

then we break it up: 

<div class="code"><pre>C: <b>1110</b>101000101110
I: 1110<b>1010</b>0010<b>1110</b>
R: 11101010<b>0010</b>1110</pre></div>

So the opcode is 1110, which tells us we're doing an ldi instruction.  The immediate is 10101110 (decimal: 174), and the register is 0010 (decimal: 2).  So this instruction should be ldi r2,174.

</p><p>Thus, to encode a mov instruction--say mov r30,r21--we use the
opcode 001011, the source register r21, or 10101, and the target
register 30, or 11100.  Using the recipe for this group of
instructions:

<div class="code"><pre>CCCCCCSRRRRRSSSS</pre></div>

We arrive at the encoding

<div class="code"><pre>0010111111000101</pre></div>

where the components of the instruction are found as: </p><div class="figure"><img src="/text/figures/6.3.2.fig1.png" width="500px"><div class="caption">Figure 6.3.2.1: The components of the mov instruction</div></div><p>Similarly, to encode the instruction breq 56, we use the opcode
111100001 and immediate value 0111000, and put these together
according to the recipe for instructions involving a 7-bit immediate
value, which was:

<div class="code"><pre>CCCCCCIIIIIIICCC</pre></div>

So we arrive at the encoding

to feed numbers into the processor (which is all the processor
understands) that will correspond to whatever instructions we want.
But because this is no longer an enumeration encoding, we must give
some thought to decodability.</p><p>For instance, suppose the computer receives from the program memory
the number

specify the operands with "?", since the instruction should be

<div class="code"><pre>0010111011110111</pre></div>

to this table, we check it against each of these patterns and discover
that the only one that matches it is mov.  So then we can break it up
as before: </p><div class="figure"><img src="/text/figures/6.3.2.fig3.png" width="500px"><div class="caption">Figure 6.3.2.3: Decoding the instruction

<div class="code"><pre>1001010000000011</pre></div>

then we go to the table and see that only inc, dec, and com can
possibly start with 1001010.  But these are distinguished by the three
bits they end with.  And only inc ends with 011.  So this is an inc
instruction, and the R bits are all 0, so this must be inc r0.  </p><p>The fact that this encoding can be decoded is no longer ensured by
enumeration, but simply by the cleverness of the AVR ISA designers.
Why this particular encoding was chosen (for instance, why the S bits
in a mov instruction are split up like that) may have to do with what
was most convenient for the people implementing the processor, or with
the way programmers worked at the time the encoding was designed.  So
while this choice of encoding feels a little arbitrary or needlessly
complicated, its original designers certainly had more constraints to
satisfy than were presented here.  </p></div></div><div class="section"><div id="sec_6_4"></div><div class="text"><div class="header">6.4:

      to understand it at a lower level than before.  The basic
      operation that happens in searching is comparing strings.  But
      really, to compare two strings, we can just compare each letter
      of the strings one after the other.  So what is this operation
      of comparing letters?  After all, we now know all the operations
      that our computer can actually do, and none of them even mention
      letters.  What gives?</p><p>As with instructions, and really everything else, the computer
      represents letters with bits.  That is, when you enter the
      string "banana".  The computer is not dealing with the string
      itself, but rather with a sequence of numbers that encode the
      string.  In this case, the sequence is:

      <div class="code"><pre>98,97,110,97,110,97</pre></div>

is still used extremely widely.  For instance, if you are reading this
book online, most of the text you are reading was encoded in ASCII to
be transmitted to your computer.  The reason is mostly inertia:
Software written back when there was only ASCII would have to be
rewritten if we switched to a more modern encoding.  </p><p>As an enumeration encoding, ASCII is definitely decodable.  In
fact, every character it encodes can be represented by a single byte,
so if we see the list of bytes

<div class="code"><pre>72,101,108,108,111,32,87,111,114,108,100,33</pre></div>

we can reference the table and readily decode this as the string

<div class="code"><pre>Hello world!</pre></div></p><p><span id="def_backwards compatible" class="definition"></span>However, we still definitely want
improvements on ASCII--accented vowels, letters from non-Roman
alphabets, and the like.  This brings up another feature of encodings:
backwards-compatibility: Suppose we have a nice fancy encoding that
encodes Chinese characters and the Cyrillic alphabet and more.  But
suppose also that for a particular application, all we're doing is
encoding English text (still using this fancy encoding).  If for this
task (for which ASCII would have sufficed) the new encoding generates
the same output as ASCII would, then older software can still accept
input in the new encoding as long as that input is just English.  In
this case we say that the new encoding is <b>backwards-compatible</b>.
</p><div class="aside"><b>Aside: What are the missing characters?</b>
  <p>ASCII is kind of an enumeration encoding, but the enumeration
  we've given here skips some numbers.  What gives?  The actual ASCII
  enumeration doesn't skip any numbers; it's just that some of the
  things they chose to encode are rarely useful anymore, and so we
  skipped them for presentation purposes here.  As a historical
  curiosity, though, we might wonder what were these other
  characters.</p>

  <p>Many old computers were just text terminals: All you could do was
  input text (no mouse) and all it could do was output text.  The
  specific way it outputted text was (roughly) the following: There
  was always a cursor on the screen.  When the user pressed the "A"
  key, this was translated to the ASCII number for "A", i.e. 65 and
  sent to the screen.  Since "A" is a normal character, the screen
  simply placed a picture of an "A" where the cursor was and moved the
  cursor one space forward.</p>

  <p>But what happened when the user pressed "Backspace", say?  This
  was represented in fact by with ASCII number 8, and when the screen
  got the number 8, it moved the cursor backward by one space.  When
  the user pressed "Enter", first the number 10 (newline) was sent to
  the screen causing the cursor to move down a line.  But we are used
  to the cursor also going to the beginning of the next line when we
  press enter.  To accomplish this, the enter key actually sent two
  numbers: 10 (for "go to the next line") and 13 (for "go to the
  beginning of the line").  </p>

  <p>Likewise there were other numbers for moving the cursor around in
  various ways, numbers corresponding to the shift key, sequences of
  ASCII characters that could change the color of the characters being
  printed, and even a character, encoded with the number 7 (not to be
  confused with the character "7", which is encoded with the number

  to the screen!  In fact, there are still terminal programs (such as
  those on Linux or OS X) that will beep when you print ASCII
  character number 7, such as with a command like:

  <div class="code"><pre>printf '\x7'</pre></div>

  Sadly, many of these terminal programs have this feature turned

	  Text--Unicode</div><p>ASCII is convenient when we want to be able to use a single
	byte to represent every character, but there are only 256
	different bytes and there are definitely languages that simply
	have more than 256 characters, or characters not covered by
	the ASCII encoding.  ASCII is not enough even if you just want
	to store proper French text, and an encoding that uses one
	byte per character will never work if you want to be able to
	store text in Chinese.</p><p>Thus a more comprehensive character encoding is needed, and
	several standards exist as attempts to fill the gap.  By far
	the most popular as of this writing is one called UTF-8
	("Universal character set Transition Format--8-bit").</p><p><span id="def_codepoint" class="definition"></span>As with ASCII, UTF-8 assigns to every
	character a unique number, called that character's
	<b>codepoint</b>.  For example, the character pictured
	here</p><div class="figure"><img src="/text/figures/6.4.2.fig1.png" width="100px"><div class="caption">Figure 6.4.2.1: Unicode codepoint 16706: 䅂</div></div><p>has codepoint 16706.  But then how does the computer actually
	store this character as a sequence of bytes?  If we simply
	convert 16706 to binary, getting 100000101000010, we could
	store this as the bytes 01000001 01000010.  But when when the
	computer goes to figure out what this means, how does it
	distinguish between the two-byte character representing
	codepoint 16706 and two one-byte characters representing
	codepoints 65 and 66 respectively (in ASCII, "A" and "B")?</p><p><span id="def_UTF-32" class="definition"></span>This is where a few possible encoding
	schemes take different ideas.  One called <b>UTF-32</b> simply
	declares that every character must take 4 bytes.  In UTF-32,
	then, this character becomes 00000000 00000000 01000001
	01000010. However this means that every single character
	is now 4 bytes--even simple English text that ASCII could
	encode in 1 byte per character.  There are other issues with
	this encoding also that we will not detail here.</p><p>At this point, UTF-8 steps up as a reasonable solution: Any
	byte that matches one in the ASCII table will have that same
	ASCII interpretation when interpreted under the UTF-8 scheme,
	but characters that require more bytes to represent them will
	also be possible.  The trick that allows it to accomplish this
	is to notice that in ASCII, every byte that is defined in the
	table has the most significant bit always 0.  </p><p>The short description of UTF-8 is this: Take the first byte
	of a character.  If the MSB is 0, then that byte is
	interpreted according to the ASCII table.  If the MSB is 1,
	though, then count off how many 1s there are until the first 0
	of the byte.  That is how many bytes are involved with this
	character.  So if the first byte is 11100101, then because
	this byte starts with three 1s, it indicates that this byte
	and the next two bytes together represent a single character.
	These next bytes that are part of the same character must
	further begin with the bits 10.  So some of the bits in a
	UTF-8-encoded character (the "1110" in the first byte, and the
	"10"s in the following bytes) are for determining which bytes
	are involved in that character.  The bits that remain are
	combined to determine the codepoint itself.</p><p>For a simple example, a single character in UTF-8 would be:

<div class="code"><pre><b>1110</b>0010
<b>10</b>011100
<b>10</b>001000</pre></div>

Here we have bolded the bits that help determine what bytes are
involved: The 1110 starting the first byte tells us that the character
is comprised of three bytes in total.  The 10s starting off the next
bytes simply indicate that those bytes are not the start of a new
character but are part of a character that starts at an earlier
byte.</p><p>The bits that remain, then, are 0010011100001000, representing the
number 9992.  If we look up this codepoint in a Unicode table, we get
the character ✈</p><p>For a multi-character example, then, say we have the sequence of bytes:

<div class="code"><pre>00100001
11000011
10110111
11100010
10011000
10111010</pre></div>

Then the first byte 00100001 starts with a 0, so is a full character
on its own (in fact, the character "!"), and thus the next byte must
be the start of the next character.  </p><p>The second byte starts with 110, which indicates that this next
character occupies two bytes--this one and the byte after it.  And
indeed the byte after it--10110111--starts with 10, so whatever this
character is, it is represented by the bytes

<div class="code"><pre>11000011
10110111</pre></div>

Since the 110 starting the first byte and the 10 starting the second
are just there to indicate that these bytes together form one
character, the remaining bytes--00011110111--together specify which
character it is.  To find out which character, we can look these up in
the UTF-8 table.  Since in decimal, this binary number is 247, we look
at the 247th entry and find that this is the division sign: ÷.</p><p>The next byte is 11100010, suggesting that the following two bytes
are also a part of this character.  So the character is comprised of
the bytes:

<div class="code"><pre>11100010
10011000
10111010</pre></div>

Of these, some of the bytes are again being used to pick out this blob
of three bytes as one character:

<div class="code"><pre><b>1110</b>0010
<b>10</b>011000
<b>10</b>111010</pre></div>

and the rest--0010011000111010--are specifying which character it is.
In decimal this is 9786, so we can look up this entry in the UTF-8
tables to discover that this character is a smiley face.</p></div></div><div class="section"><div id="sec_6_4_3"></div><div class="text"><div class="header">6.4.3: 
	  Which encoding to use?</div><p>So with all of these encodings and many that we haven't mentioned,
which is the best?  As always, "best" can only be defined relative to
a stated purpose.  In this case, we need to think about how we plan to
use the characters that we are encoding.  For example, if we are
programming a text editor, we may be storing a large number of bytes
representing encoded characters, and may wish at some point to
identify how many characters are actually present.</p><p>With ASCII this is easy: Each character is one byte, so the number
of bytes in the text is the number of characters.  With UTF-32, this
is also easy: Every character is 4 bytes, so the number of characters
is the number of bytes divided by 4.  With UTF-8, this is not so
easy--if I have 100 bytes, it might be 100 one-byte characters, or it
might be 50 two-byte characters, or possibly some mix of several
different length characters.  To find out the true answer, we have
essentially no choice but to walk through each character and count
them.</p><p>On the other hand, suppose we're making a web browser.  In this
case, we may find ourselves having to start decoding a string of
characters somewhere in the middle--maybe for a text chat application.
In this case, we may be missing some of the bytes from the beginning
of the representation.  In ASCII this is fine--the result will be
interpreted as if we just left off some characters.  </p><p>In UTF-32, however, this can go very very poorly: Imagine we had
the string "Hello", represented in UTF-32 as:

<div class="code"><pre>
00000000 00000000 00000000 01001000 
00000000 00000000 00000000 01100101 
00000000 00000000 00000000 01101010 
00000000 00000000 00000000 01101010 
00000000 00000000 00000000 01101111 
</pre></div>

And suppose the first two bytes were removed, leaving us with 


<div class="code"><pre>
00000000 01001000 00000000 00000000 
00000000 01100101 00000000 00000000 
00000000 01101010 00000000 00000000 
00000000 01101010 00000000 00000000 
00000000 01101111 
</pre></div>

Now, if we try to interpret this as UTF-32, we get dramatically
different results, as these 4-byte blobs represent massive codepoints
with unknown characters.</p><p>By contrast, if you chop off the first two bytes of a UTF-8
representation, say:

<div class="code"><pre>01100101
11110000
10011111
10010000
10110001
11110000
10011111
10011011
10100111</pre></div>

leaving us only with

<div class="code"><pre>
10011111
10010000
10110001
11110000
10011111
10011011
10100111</pre></div>

Then we see the first three bytes all start with "10".  10 can never
be the starting bits of a character, so we know immediately that these
are missing something, and can discard them and start interpreting
from the next valid character start: 11110000.  In this case, we lose
some characters off the beginning like in the case of ASCII, but we do
not lose all meaning entirely.</p></div></div><div class="section"><div id="sec_6_5"></div><div class="text"><div class="header">6.5:

	  upside down?  This comes to the last oddity (that we'll
	  discuss, anyway) about the BMP encoding, namely that the
	  first pixel stored is the bottom right pixel, and then the
	  pixels proceed right-to-left, bottom-to-top.  (So in fact,
	  if we had selected a less symmetric image, it would not only
	  be upside-down, but would also be mirror-imaged.)</p><p>BMP is only one encoding for images.  It is simple to
	  understand (which is why we included it) but it is not
	  particularly efficient and thus sees little use in the wild
	  these days, with preference given to encodings such as GIF,
	  PNG, JPEG, and WEBP.  To illustrate the basic idea behind
	  the inefficiency of BMP, we could describe the image above

      there are 8 wires going between the accelerometer and the
      processor.  But since the device is also a phone, it's got an
      antenna transmitting as well, which means that all of these
      wires are very close to some decently powerful radio
      transmissions.  And radio waves near a wire can cause current to
      flow through that wire--this is, after all, how an antenna works
      in the first place.  So we run the risk of at least one of the
      signals on one of the wires being changed to something other
      than what the accelerometer device intended to send.</p><p>So, for example, if we were trying to send the x-acceleration
      as the number 23, i.e. as 00010111 on the 8 wires, the radio
      interference could flip one of these bits in transit and the
      processor could receive the value 01010111, or 87, instead.</p><p>Thus the simple encoding of: "Turn the number into binary and
      then send out the bits on wires" may be inadequate to ensure
      successful communication.</p></div></div><div class="section"><div id="sec_6_6_1"></div><div class="text"><div class="header">6.6.1: 
	  Sensor data with repetition for error-detection</div><p>One simple (if somewhat heavy-handed) change would be to
	have instead of 8 wires, have three sets of 8 wires, and send
	the same number out on all three.  The calculation is that
	while there is a chance of one bit being flipped, there is a
	much lower chance of two or more being flipped.  So if we are
	trying to send the number 23, we will send

<div class="code"><pre>00010111
00010111
00010111</pre></div>

If the processor receives this, then it can be reasonably confident that the intended number was indeed 23.  But maybe there was interference and the processor receives: 

<div class="code"><pre>00010111
01010111
00010111</pre></div>

Now it can be reasonably sure of all but the second bit.  But either
this second bit was transmitted as a 0 three times and one of those
got flipped to a 1, or it was transmitted as a 1 three times and two
of those got flipped to 0.  Because we're estimating that even one bit
getting flipped is not so likely, the odds of it being the former
situation vastly outweigh the odds of it being the latter.  So we can
make the educated guess that it was probably sent as a 0 and just one
of the three transmissions got flipped.  Thus, even though there was
interference, the processor can still safely conclude the number
transmitted was 00010111.  </p><p><span id="def_error-correcting code" class="definition"></span>This is an example of an
<b>error-correcting code</b>--that is, an encoding for the data that
is done in such a way that even if some bits of the data were
accidentally (or maliciously!) flipped in transit, the intended
message can still be deduced from the error-filled data that the
processor received.</p><p>It is worth mentioning that this error-correcting code can correct
up to 8 errors, if they happen to all fall in the right places.  For
instance, if the intended message was again

<div class="code"><pre>00010111
00010111
00010111</pre></div>

But the processor receives 

<div class="code"><pre>10100111
01010111
00011101</pre></div>

then it can still analyze this by taking, for each bit, the majority value.  For instance, the first bit was sent as 1 once and as 0 twice, so the processor assumes this was a 0.  Continuing thus, we get: 

<div class="code"><pre>10100111
01010111
00011101
00010111</pre></div>

However, if the errors happened to line up so that one bit got flipped twice, as in 

<div class="code"><pre>01010111
01011111
00000111</pre></div>

then the processor would deduce an intended value of 01010111, which
would be incorrect.  So an error-correcting code cannot correct
arbitrary errors.  They are therefore designed to correct for as many
errors as are considered both plausible and intolerable in the
situation they are designed for.  In the case of a mobile phone
accelerometer, an error may result in your phone's screen rotating
when it shouldn't once in a while, so if errors are so rare that this
will only happen on average once per year, say, there may not be much
reason to use any error-correction.  On the other hand, systems used
in satellites are exposed to all the radiation and associated
interference from the sun (as they are unprotected by our
atmosphere), and they can have more mission-critical applications, so
they may have some very beefy error-correcting codes indeed.</p></div></div><div class="section"><div id="sec_6_6_2"></div><div class="text"><div class="header">6.6.2: 
	  Sensor data with parity-bit error detection</div><p>The above scheme of sending the same value three times
	required rather a lot of work: In fact it required tripling
	the number of transmissions being made.  If you have a lot of
	money and cannot afford error, this may be the way to go, but
	if you cannot justify tripling the cost of your hardware, then
	a slightly lighter-weight method may be more appropriate.  One
	such method is to use a <b>parity bit</b>.</p><p><span id="def_parity bit" class="definition"></span>In this encoding scheme, we send
	only one extra bit in addition to the required 8, rather than
	an additional 16.  This extra bit will be sent as 0 if the
	number of 1s in the transmitted number is even, and 0 if it is
	odd.  If we intend to send the number 23, i.e. 00010111, then
	because this has an even number of 1s, we actually send the
	number 00010111<b>0</b>, where this last bit is the so-called
	parity bit.</p><p>So if the processor receives the transmission 010101110,
	then it notices that the number has an odd number of 1s, but
	the parity bit is 0.  Therefore it concludes that some bit in
	the transmission was corrupted.  Unlike in the previous
	scheme, it cannot tell which bit was corrupted.  The intended
	transmission might have been 010001110 but then the 4th bit
	got flipped.  Or it might have been 010101111 and the parity
	bit got flipped!  All the processor can determine is that the
	transmission was likely in some way corrupted in transit.
	<span id="def_error-detecting" class="definition"></span>This is an example of an
	<b>error-detecting encoding</b>--it allows us to determine
	that there was an error, but not to fix it. This may be
	suitable in cases where errors are not too harmful, and where
	the cost of re-sending the data is low.</p><p>But in this example, this is fine, since the processor can
	in this event just ask the accelerometer for a new reading
	until it gets one with a correct parity bit.</p><p>Note that just like in the previous example, if two bits
	happen get flipped in transit, e.g. 000101101 then the error
	will go unnoticed, since the number now has 3 1s and the
	parity bit is correspondingly 1, as we expected.  Once again,
	encodings that are robust against transmission error are
	always designed to protect against specified levels of
	corruption depending on the application.  They can never
	defend against all possible errors.</p></div></div><div class="section"><div id="sec_6_7"></div><div class="text"><div class="header">6.7:

	  Search engine: Life cycle of a search</div><p>For our search engine example, we'll presuppose a search
      engine has already crawled the internet and all the documents we
      want to be able to search.  Into this world walks our user, who
      has opened a browser on a computer and subsequently types a
      query.  This is supposed to cause links to webpages that match
      this query to appear on the computer's screen.  Let's watch how
      this happens in detail:</p><p>
	<ul>
	  <!-- Figure: Cat walking across laptop keyboard with
	       nonsense appearing in search box-->
	  <li>User presses buttons on keyboard.  </li>

	  
	  <!-- Figure: Keyboard -> CPU with numbers going along wire
	       -->
	  <li>Keyboard hardware outputs corresponding numbers numbers
	  and sends them to the computer.</li>

	  <li>
	    Browser program was written in a high-level language and
	    uses something like the Python input() command (though a
	    bit more refined) to accept the user's text.  This was
	    compiled to ISA instructions, which are running on the
	    user's computer.  The input() command was compiled to
	    input ISA instructions (like "in") being run in a loop,
	    waiting to receive inputs from the keyboard.  Since the
	    keyboard is now sending numbers, these input instructions
	    receive numbers.
	  </li>

	  <li>
	    The browser stores the ASCII (or perhaps UTF-8) character
	    encodings corresponding to the buttons the user has
	    pressed in RAM (so that it will be ready to send the
	    user's query when "Enter" is pressed).
	  </li>
	  
	  <li>
	    The browser should also display the letters the user is
	    typing as they are typed.  To this end, the browser
	    program has already stored in RAM encoded graphics (much
	    like the smiley-face example above) for all the possible
	    letters.  (This set of pictures is called a "font".)
	    Having got the numbers from the keyboard, the browser
	    executes "load from RAM" instructions to load the
	    corresponding encoded pictures from RAM.  It then executes
	    output instructions to send these encoded pictures to the
	    screen, causing the letters that the user typed to be
	    displayed.
	  </li>

	  
	  <!-- Figure: cat sitting on "Enter" key
	       -->
	  <li>
	    The browser eventually receives numbers corresponding to
	    "Enter" button keypress.  It now executes output
	    instructions to send the encoded (ASCII or UTF-8, say)
	    search query to the network card along with some
	    additional metadata telling the network card to send these
	    numbers out on the network specifically to the search
	    engine server.
	  </li>

	  
	  <li>
	    Search engine server network card receives query and
	    communicates them to the search engine computer.
	  </li>
	  <li>
	    The search engine computer is constantly executing input
	    instructions to check for input and receives the query in
	    the course of doing so.
	  </li>
	  <li>
	    The search engine computer then executes input
	    instructions to read from a hard drive the various
	    documents it has stored (all, of course, encoded as well).
	  </li>
	  <li>
	    The search engine computer then executes comparison
	    instructions to compare the numbers that encode the query
	    string with the stored numbers that encode the searchable
	    documents.  As it does this, it also executes arithmetic
	    instructions to count how many matches it finds in each
	    document and makes a note of the highest few counts it has
	    seen thus far.
	  </li>
	  <li>
	    The search engine computer then outputs numbers that
	    encode links to the highest-scoring documents to its
	    network card with instructions to please send these
	    numbers to the computer that sent the original request.
	  </li>
	  <li>
	    The search engine computer's network sends these numbers
	    back to the user's computer on the network.
	  </li>
	  <li>
	    The browser program is waiting for the search results to
	    come back, and so is repeatedly executing input
	    instructions.  It therefore receives the input coming in
	    from the network card, which are numbers that encode the .
	  </li>
	  <li>
	    The browser then takes these numbers, loads from
	    RAM up the corresponding pictures of letters for each
	    number, and displays those pictures on the screen, which
	    the user can read as search results.

	  Game console: Life cycle of a button press</div><p>The user presses a button on the game console's controller.
      This is supposed to cause a character on screen to move forward.
      If the character in doing so knocks something to the ground, the
      player gets points.</p><p>From the user's perspective, they press the button and the
      picture on the screen changes in a way that looks like their
      character moving and a points counter possibly incrementing.  If
      all this is the work of a computer, then somehow all that
      happened was rapid manipulation of electronic representations of
      numbers.  Let us now consider what this looks like: </p><p>
	<ul>
	  <li>
	    User presses button
	  </li>
	  <li>
	    Game was written in high-level language and calls a
	    library function to listen for button presses.
	  </li>
	  <li>
	    The compiled version of this function is executing input
	    instructions that eventually receive the information about
	    the button press.
	  </li>
	  <li>
	    The program then takes the button press and runs code to
	    model the change in game state.  Since the character
	    should move forward, this means the x-coordinate of the
	    player should be increased.  In high-level code, this
	    looks like:

	    <div class="code"><pre>player_x = player_x + 5</pre></div>

	    But the code that is actually being run on the computer is
	    of course the compiled version of this--something more
	    like
	    
	    <div class="code"><pre>ldi r31, 5
add r30,r31</pre></div>
	  </li>
	  <li>
	    After updating the player's position, the game has to
	    determine whether the player has collided with anything
	    (and if so, to either move that something if it is
	    movable, or to bump the player back if it is not).  The
	    program does this by comparing the positions of the
	    character's outermost edges with the positions of all
	    nearby objects (naturally, using comparison instructions)
	    and updating positions accordingly.  The programmer who
	    wrote the game would have coded this with if statements
	    like

	    <div class="code"><pre>if(object_is_movable[1]):
   object_x_coordinate = object_x_coordinate + 5
else:
   player_x = player_x - 5</pre></div>

            which will be compiled to ISA code using branch
            instructions that will actually be run on the console
            computer.
	  </li>
	  <li>
	    Now that the scene is modeled, the score needs to be
	    updated.  To determine how to modify the score, further
	    comparisons are done between objects and the ground like:

	    <div class="code"><pre>if(object_y_coordinate[1] &lt;= 0):
   player_score = player_score + 1</pre></div>

            This is, as usual, stored as encoded ISA instructions
            involving comparisons and branching.
	  </li>
	  <li>
	    Now the scene is set: The program has numbers that
	    describe the coordinates of all the objects on screen, and
	    the program has stored encoded graphics of all the
	    characters and objects that should appear.  It could run
	    some further processing code to combine all of these to
	    one image and output that image to screen, but a game
	    console usually has specialized rendering hardware.  So
	    instead, it can execute output instructions to output the
	    information about the individual character and object
	    graphics, their locations, and the text describing the
	    current score all to some specialized hardware that
	    combines them and in turn outputs the image to the screen.
	  </li>
	</ul>

	  Mobile phone: Life cycle of a text message</div><p>The interface for text messaging is perhaps the simplest of
      all: user enters a friend's phone number and some text on their
      phone, presses send, and that text appears on the friend's
      phone.  In terms of the fundamental intermediate steps that
      enable this, this example is not too different from the others:
      </p><p>
	<ul>
	  <li>
	    Phone displays keyboard on its touchscreen.
	  </li>
	  <li>
	    User presses areas on the touch screen
	  </li>
	  <li>
	    Phone executes input instructions from the touch screen to
	    get the coordinates where the user touched..
	  </li>
	  <li>
	    Phone has stored the coordinates of all the keys it
	    displayed, and executes comparison instructions to see
	    whether the user pressed within one of the keys and if so,
	    which one.
	  </li>
	  <li>
	    Phone finds that user pressed "M" key.  Stores the number
	    77 (ASCII for "M") into RAM as a part of the text message.
	  </li>
	  <li>
	    User eventually finishes and pushes down on the part of
	    the touch screen displaying a picture of the "Send"
	    button.
	  </li>
	  <li>
	    Phone performs more comparisons of coordinates and
	    discovers that the user indeed pressed "Send".
	  </li>
	  <li>
	    Phone takes the text message and prepares to output it to
	    the radio.  Radio is a very noisy means of communication,
	    and the cellular network tower may receive a corrupted
	    version of what the phone's radio sends due to all kinds
	    of interference from other phones, from gamma rays,
	    distortion from the fact that the phone is moving as it
	    sends the message, and who knows what else.  So before the
	    phone outputs the encoded message to the radio, it further
	    encodes it with an error-correcting code.  For example,
	    the message "Meow", which would normally be encoded
	    with
	    <div class="code"><pre>01001101
01100101
01101111
01110111</pre></div>

	    would be encoded using a three-repetition error-correcting
	    code as:

<div class="code"><pre>01001101
01001101
01001101
01100101
01100101
01100101
01101111
01101111
01101111
01110111
01110111
01110111</pre></div>
	  </li>
	  <li>
	    Phone now outputs the text message, encoded in ASCII and
	    then encoded further in an error-correcting code, to the
	    radio.
	  </li>
	  <li>
	    Friend's phone is executing input instructions and
	    receives a message on its radio indicating the presence of
	    a new text message.  It executes input instructions to get
	    the encoded message into its RAM.
	  </li>
	  <li>
	    Friend's phone then checks that in every block of three
	    bytes, all the bits are identical.  It finds that in one
	    of them--the three bytes representing the second
	    character--there are differences:
	    <div class="code"><pre>
01100101
01000101
01100100
	    </pre></div>
	    
	    Since two of the bytes have third bit 1, however, it
	    concludes that the other byte must have originally had
	    third bit 1 as well.  Likewise for the 8th bit, and it
	    therefore uses 01100101 as its interpretation of the
	    character.

	    <br><br>

	    For example, the programmer would have written something
	    like:

	    <div class="code"><pre>if(byte1 == byte2 and byte2 == byte3):
   text_message[i] = byte1</pre></div>

            to say that if the three bytes are all the same, then just
	    use the first byte as the corresponding character in the
	    text message.
	    
	  </li>
	  <li>
	    Now having decoded the error-correcting code and having
	    stored ASCII encoding of the characters corresponding to
	    the original text message, the phone also has a font
	    stored.  Since the first character is 77, it looks up the
	    77th picture in the font and uses output instructions to
	    communicate that picture to the screen, ultimately showing
	    the user an 'M'.  The second character is the number 101,
	    so it displays picture number 101 onto the screen, showing
	    the user 'e', and so on until the user sees the whole
	    message.
