	  Physical representations of numbers</div><div class="summary"><b>Summary: </b><p>Computers are devices that perform operations on numbers.
  A computer is also supposed to be a real-world physical machine,
  whereas a number is something abstract.  We will bridge that gap
  in this chapter by introducing binary representations of
  numbers.</p></div><p>Recall our two organizing questions: How do we program a
    computer? How do we build a computer?  We've now addressed the
    first question at a high level: We can program a computer using
    the nice human-adapted programming language of Python and let
    the compiler take care of the dirty work of actually telling the
    machine the corresponding machine-friendly operations.  </p><p>In the next chapter, we'll start to address the question of
    what those machine-friendly operations are.  In other words,
    "How do we really program a computer?"  However, as we descend
    closer to the level of the computer itself, we start to run into
    questions related to the construction of computers.  (In other
    words, the abstraction of a computer leaks!)  </p><p>It will be profitable to plateau on our journey down the
    tower of abstractions and take a chapter to address one of these
    in particular.  Specifically, consider the following conundrum:
    A computer is supposed to be a physical machine, but it is also
    supposed to be able to add and subtract numbers.  Numbers are
    abstract, whereas the computer is physical, so when we say that
    the computer "adds" two numbers, we must mean instead that it
    takes two physical things--maybe pieces of paper with holes in
    them, or electrons flowing through wires, or perhaps something
    else entirely--that represent the two numbers it should add, and
    it outputs somehow into a third physical thing (paper,
    electrons, etc.) that represents the sum.</p><p>This will affect our understanding of how to program computers
    at a low-level: Low-level arithmetic operations will act on
    numbers, but they will be constrained and influenced by how the
    computer actually represents the numbers that it is adding and
    subtracting.  So we take a detour to study the following question:
    How can we represent numbers and operations on numbers physically?
    </p></div></div><div class="section"><div id="sec_4_1"></div><div class="text"><div class="header">4.1:

      various different classes of numbers.  Each system is introduced
      with a section describing it conceptually, as well as the
      associated terminology and the procedures for working with it.
      Following these introductions, there will be sections containing
      worked examples of manipulating numbers within that system.</p></div></div><div class="section"><div id="sec_4_2"></div><div class="text"><div class="header">4.2: 
	  Unary representation of numbers: A bouncy-ball-based
    computer</div><div class="summary"><b>Summary: </b><p>Before we get to binary--the main goal of this
    chapter--we present the simplest possible way of realizing
    numbers as physical things: To represent the number 15, say,
    simply take 15 identical objects.  This is called a "unary"
    representation, and it could be used to build a computer rather
    easily.  This computer would be fundamentally limited in the
    size of the numbers it could deal with, however.</p><br><br><b>Definitions: </b><a href="#def_unary">unary</a></div><p>A very simple way of representing numbers physically is to
      have a large supply of identical small objects--say bouncy
      balls, for example--and then to represent the operation of
      storing a given number in a specific slot by taking that
      number of bouncy balls and physically placing them in a slot
      with the specified name.  So, for example, a machine might see
      the program "x = 2" and physically take an empty container,
      write "x" on it, and then fill it with 2 bouncy balls.</p><p>Adding numbers is also quite easy: For our computer to be
      able to perform e.g., <div class="icode">x = x + 5</div> it needs to have
      a contraption that, when it sees this operation, finds the
      container marked "x", and places 5 more bouncy balls into it.
      </p><p>For the purpose of writing down these representations, we
      will use the digit "1" to stand in for a single bouncy ball.
      For instance, we can write the bouncy-ball representation of 9
      as: 

      <div class="code"><pre>111111111</pre></div>

      And the addition of 9 and 4 would be written:

      <div class="code"><pre>111111111 + 1111 = 1111111111111</pre></div>

      <div id="def_unary" class="definition"></div>This way of representing numbers is called
      <b>unary</b>, so-called because the 'un-' prefix indicates
      that we only need a single digit (1) to write down the
      representation of any number (just as the usual system of
      writing numbers is called "decimal", the prefix "deci-"
      referring to the use of 10 digits: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8,
      9). Unary is conceptually very convenient for
      machine-building purposes--arithmetic operations are trivial
      to describe--but it becomes terribly unwieldy when dealing
      with numbers that are at all large.  For example, the number
      that is so compactly written in decimal notation as 134 would
      be written in unary as:

      <div class="code"><pre>11111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111
111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111</pre></div>

      If we tried to run our factorial program on a unary-based
      computer, we could easily need more bouncy balls than there
      are atoms in the universe!  So unary might be nice for a
      simple, slow computer, but not so much for the powerful and
      compact computers we are used to.
      </p></div></div><div class="section"><div id="sec_4_2_1"></div><div class="text"><div class="header">4.2.1: 
	  Worked examples</div><p>As we've seen, representing numbers in unary is easy: Just
	write that number of 1s.  So 17 is "11111111111111111".
	In the other direction, decoding a unary representation into a
	number is equally easy: Just count the 1s in the
	representation.  So "1111111111111111111111111" is the
	representation of 25.  </p><p>But remember that the point of this representation was to
	be able to build a machine that stores and adds numbers for
	us.  We've talked a little about how this can be done, but
	we'll take this opportunity to flesh out some of those ideas a
	little.</p><p>We can imagine the machine consisting of three basic parts
	(as a call-out to the next chapter, these parts could be called
	the machine's "architecture"):
	
	<ul>
	  <li>20 trays for storing bouncy balls, numbered 0-19.</li>
	  <li>Two inputs, labeled input "A" and input "B", for feeding in
	  bouncy balls.</li>
	  <li>Three buttons labeled:
	  <ol>
	    <li><div class="icode">Store input B into tray A</div></li>
	    <li><div class="icode">Add input B to stored value in tray A</div></li>
	    <li><div class="icode">Add tray B to tray A</div></li>
	  </ol></li>
	  <li>A very large reservoir of bouncy balls for use in
	  computations.</li>
	</ul>
	
	</p><p>At any point, you can place however many bouncy balls into
	the two inputs.  We just need to specify what happens when you
	press each of the buttons.  You should stop and consider what
	might be reasonable, and even work through to whatever desired
	level of detail how to construct a machine that behaves in the
	way described.</p><font color="blue"><u>What happens when you press "Store input B into tray A"?</u></font><br>
	    <p>When we press "Store input B into tray A", the machine
	    looks at the number of bouncy balls in input A, finds the
	    corresponding tray (for example, if we place 4 bouncy
	    balls into input A, it finds tray number 4).  It then
	    empties this tray of any balls it may have had previously
	    (placing these into the reservoir), and dumps all the
	    balls placed in input "B" into that tray.  </p>
	
	    <p>So if we place 5 balls in input "A", 10 in input "B",
	    and press "Store", tray 5 will be emptied into the
	    reservoir and then the 10 balls in "B" will be dumped into
	    the newly empty tray 5.  </p><font color="blue"><u>What happens when you press "Add input B to stored value in tray A"?</u></font><br>
	  <p>When we press "Add input B to stored value in tray A",
	  the balls in input "A" should select which stored container
	  to use, and the balls in input "B" should be dumped into
	  that container, exactly as in the case of the "Store"
	  button, except without emptying it first.</p>

	  <p>So if we place 19 balls in "A" and 6 in "B", then the
	  machine will place the 6 balls from input "B" into container
	  number 19, adding to however many were in that container to
	  begin with.  </p>
	  <font color="blue"><u>What happens when you press "Add tray B to tray A"?</u></font><br>
	  <p>In this case, the two inputs both represent containers:
	  The number of balls in input "A" tells is which container to
	  add balls to, and the number of balls in input "B" tells us
	  which container to add them from.  Except we don't want to
	  remove those balls from the second container--we just want
	  to add the same number to the first container.  </p>
	  
	  <p>So if we place 19 balls in "A" and 6 in "B", then the
	  machine will look at containers 19 and 6.  Count how many
	  balls are in container 6, and take the same number of balls
	  from the reservoir, and add that many balls to container
	  19.</p>

	  Binary representation of non-negative integers</div><div class="summary"><b>Summary: </b><p>Unary was convenient because it had only one digit, so
    we could represent it easily with physical objects.  It was bad
    at representing large numbers compactly, however.  Decimal, on
    the other hand, is good at representing numbers compactly, but
    it is sort of complicated--having 10 different possible digits.
    Binary is a happy medium--a representation that is simple,
    having only two different digits, but also compact.</p><br><br><b>Definitions: </b><a href="#def_bit">bit</a>, <a href="#def_unsigned">unsigned</a>, <a href="#def_significant">significant</a>, <a href="#def_LSB">LSB</a>, <a href="#def_MSB">MSB</a>, <a href="#def_width">width</a>, <a href="#def_byte">byte</a>, <a href="#def_word">word</a>, <a href="#def_nibble">nibble</a></div><p>A representation that is still simple enough to be suitable
      for machines but also compact enough to represent large
      numbers in less space is binary.  In binary, as the prefix
      'bi-' suggests, we use two digits: 0 and 1.  </p><p>To understand precisely how it works, we can think back to
      the decimal representation that we're used to: When we write
      the number 134, all we've done is to put the digits 1, 3, and
      4 next to each other, and somehow this can denotes a
      relatively large number--134.  It does so by the notion of
      place-value: The right-most digit--4--represents how many 1s
      we have.  The next digit represents how many 10s we have.  The
      next, how many 100s.  And so on.  So 134 means: four 1s, three 10s,
      and one 100, which communicates the desired quantity:

      <table border="1px" cellpadding="2px">
	<tr><td>How many...</td><td>100s?</td><td>10s?</td><td>1s?</td></tr>
	<tr><td>Decimal digits</td><td>1</td><td>3</td><td>4</td></tr>
      </table>
      </p><p>We used 1, 10, and 100 as the place values because these
      are powers of 10.  Why we use powers of anything at all is an
      interesting mathematical idea that we will leave aside for
      now.  Why we use powers of 10 specifically had to do with the
      fact that we were using 10 possible digits--0-9 (which in turn
      had to do with the fact that most humans have 10 fingers to
      use as a counting aid).  </p><p><div id="def_bit" class="definition"></div>Binary, by contrast, will only have two
      digits--0 and 1.  (Binary digits are also called
      <b>bits</b>.) And because we have two possible digits, we
      will use the powers of 2 for our place values: 1, 2, 4, 8, 16,
      32, 64, 128, 256, 1024, etc.  Thus the number in binary 11001
      represents one 1, no 2s, no 4s, one 8, and one 16, for a total
      of 25.</p><p>Similarly, the number that we wrote in decimal as 134 can be
      written in binary by breaking it up into powers of 2: To make
      134 we need one 128, one 4, and one 2.  So:

      <table border="1px" cellpadding="2px">
	<tr><td>How many...</td><td>128s?</td><td>64s?</td><td>32s?</td><td>16s?</td><td>8s?</td><td>4s?</td><td>2s?</td><td>1s?</td></tr>
	<tr><td>Binary digits</td><td>1</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>0</td></tr>
      </table>

      <p>Put more mathematically, if we have a binary number with bits
      a<sub>n</sub>, ..., a<sub>1</sub>, a<sub>0</sub>, where
      a<sub>i</sub> is the i-th digit from the right (so each
      a<sub>i</sub> is either a 0 or a 1), then we have a formula for
      the number this represents:
	
      <div class="code"><pre>a<sub>n</sub>...a<sub>1</sub>a<sub>0</sub> = a<sub>n</sub> * 2<sup>n</sup> + ... + a<sub>1</sub> * 2<sup>1</sup> + a<sub>0</sub> * 2<sup>0</sup></pre></div>

      Since 134 = 128 + 4 + 2 = 2<sup>7</sup> + 2<sup>2</sup> +
      2<sup>1</sup> = 1 * 2<sup>7</sup> + 0 * 2<sup>6</sup> + 0 * 2<sup>5</sup> + 0 * 2<sup>4</sup> + 0 * 2<sup>3</sup> + 1 * 2<sup>2</sup> + 1 * 2<sup>1</sup> + 0 * 2<sup>0</sup>, the binary representation of 134 is 10000110.  
      </p>
      
      <div id="def_unsigned" class="definition"></div>Since we're
      talking about non-negative integers, that is, integers where
      there is no concern about sign--whether it is positive or
      negative--this is sometimes called the representation of an
      <b>unsigned integer</b>.
      </p><p><div id="def_significant" class="definition"></div>As in decimal, the first bits in a
      binary number have a much greater effect on the value: The
      difference between 1561 and 1562 isn't that large, but the
      difference between 1561 and 2561 is very large in comparison.
      For this reason it is common to call the first bits of a
      binary number more <b>significant</b>. Using this
      terminology, the last two bits would be called the two "least
      significant bits".  <div id="def_LSB" class="definition"></div>Especially common is
      calling the last bit the <b>least significant bit</b> or
      <b>LSB</b> <div id="def_MSB" class="definition"></div>and the first bit, the
      <b>most significant bit</b> or <b>MSB</b>.</p><p>With 8 decimal digits, the largest number we can represent
      is 99999999--i.e., one less than the next place value of
      100000000.  With 8 binary digits, the largest number we can
      represent is 11111111, or 255--one less than the next place
      value of 256.  In general, if we have an <i>n</i>-bit binary
      number, it can be a number anywhere from 0 through
      2<sup>n</sup>-1.</p><p>To build a computer based on binary, we need a way to
      represent bits physically.  This is also not too hard.  If we
      wish to build our computer out of bouncy balls, then instead
      of just having a tray that can hold however many bouncy balls,
      we can have a tray subdivided into cells, and each cell can
      hold at most one bouncy ball.  So to store 8 bits, we need a
      container with 8 cells, and to store the value of 134, instead
      of having 134 bouncy balls, we only need 3:</p><div class="figure"><img src="/text/figures/4.3.fig1.png" width="400px"><div class="caption">Figure 4.3.1: </div></div><p>In practice, computers are electrical devices, and bits are
      stored using cells that can either store electrical charge or
      not, where the presence of electrical charge stands for the
      bit being a 1, and the absence of charge stands for it being
      0.  We can then create an 8-bit storage container by taking 8
      of these cells as we did with the bouncy balls.</p><p>However, if our computer's memory containers have only a
      fixed number of bits--in this example, 8--then this means we
      can only store numbers that can be represented with 8 bits.
      As the largest 8-digit binary number is 11111111, or 255 in
      decimal, this means 8-bit memories can only store numbers
      0-255.  Of course, we could do better by using more
      bits--modern processors often have 64-bit memories, which can
      store numbers up to 2<sup>64</sup>-1, or around 16
      quintillion.  But in general, the computer's internal storage
      will be limited in this way to storing only numbers of a fixed
      width, and then it is up to programmers to concoct ways to use
      these limited memories to store larger numbers if they are
      needed.</p><p><div id="def_width" class="definition"></div>The number of bits that an individual
      memory slot can store is called its <b>width</b>.  A few
      particular widths of memories come up frequently, and so have
      special terminology associated with them:

      <ul><li><div id="def_byte" class="definition"></div>A memory slot that can store an 8-bit

	  <p>Since the place values are the powers of 2, with
	  2<sup>0</sup> being on the right and increasing from right
	  to left, and since the digits tell us how many of the
	  corresponding place value to include, we can make a table:</p>

	  <p>So this corresponds to 128 + 32 + 4 + 1 = 165.  </p>

	  <p>Alternatively, we can use the formula:

	  <div class="code"><pre>a<sub>n</sub>...a<sub>1</sub>a<sub>0</sub> = a<sub>n</sub> * 2<sup>n</sup> + ... + a<sub>1</sub> * 2<sup>1</sup> + a<sub>0</sub> * 2<sup>0</sup></pre></div>

	  </p>
	<p><b>Representing a number in binary:</b> </p><font color="blue"><u>Write down the
	binary representation of the number 71</u></font><br><p> Since each binary digit corresponds to whether or
	not to include the corresponding power of 2, all we have to do
	is work out which powers of 2 are needed to make up the given
	number.  We can start by noticing that all powers of 2 such as
	2<sup>7</sup> = 128 and above are too big and stand no chance
	of being included.  </p>

	<p>So we can start with 2<sup>6</sup> = 64.  If we include
	that, then to make 71, we only need further powers of 2 to
	make 7 more (as 71 - 64 = 7).  </p>

	<p>To make this 7, we may therefore skip 2<sup>5</sup> = 32,
	and 2<sup>4</sup> = 16 and 2<sup>3</sup> = 8, and the next
	power of 2 that is small enough to be included is
	2<sup>2</sup> = 4.  So now we've included 64 and 4, for a
	total of 68.  To make the desired total of 71, we need 3
	more.  </p>

	<p>To make this 3, we start by including the next power of 2:
	2<sup>1</sup> = 2.  Having included 64, 4, and 2, we have a
	total of 70, which is just 1 shy of the desired 71.  </p>

	<p>To make up for this missing 1, we include the last power of
	2: 2<sup>0</sup> = 1.  So the powers of 2 we include are 64,
	4, 2, and 1.  </p>

	<p>What we've done is written 71 as
	2<sup>6</sup>+2<sup>2</sup>+2<sup>1</sup>+2<sup>0</sup>.  Or,
	more suggestively, this same thing can be written as:

	<div class="code"><pre>71 = 1 * 2<sup>6</sup> + 0 * 2<sup>5</sup> + 0 * 2<sup>4</sup> + 0 * 2<sup>3</sup> + 1 * 2<sup>2</sup> + 1 * 2<sup>1</sup> + 1 * 2<sup>0</sup></pre></div>

	Referring back to our formula, this means that the binary
	representation for 71 is "1000111".  </p>

	<p>To summarize the work we did here: We started with 71.  We
	then proceeded down the powers of 2: 64, 32, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1,
	and noted if we could take one away from what remained.  If we
	could take away that power of 2, we did so and wrote a 1 in
	the binary representation.  Otherwise, we wrote a 0.  To wit:
	<ul>
	  <li>71 remains.  First small enough power of 2 is 64.  This
	  can be taken away, so add a 1 to the representation.  Take
	  it away and have 7 remaining.  Representation so far:
	  <b>1</b>.</li>
	  <li>7 remains.  Next power of 2 is 32.  This cannot be taken
	  away, so add a 0 to the representation.

	  <li>7 remains.  Next power of 2 is 16.  This cannot be taken
	  away, so add a 0 to the representation.

	  <li>7 remains.  Next power of 2 is 4.  This can be taken

	  remains.  Representation so far: <b>10001</b>.</li>
	  <li>3 remains.  Next power of 2 is 2.  This can be taken

	  Binary representation of negative integers</div><div class="summary"><b>Summary: </b><p>Our main storage mechanism in a computer will be
    devices that can store sequences of bits.  Most often, these
    bits will be understood to represent non-negative integers
    according to the above scheme.  However, it will be convenient
    to represent other types of numbers using sequences of bits as
    well.  In this section, we describe how to store general
    integers that can be either positive or negative.  </p>

    <p>The most common way of representing negative numbers is
    called two's complement, and consists of taking the same
    place-values as above except that the largest one is
    negative.</p><br><br><b>Definitions: </b><a href="#def_sign%20bit">sign bit</a>, <a href="#def_twos%20complement">twos complement</a></div><p>There are two common ways of representing arbitrary
      integers as sequences of bits: With a sign bit, and with two's
      complement.  </p><p><div id="def_sign bit" class="definition"></div>The <b>sign bit</b> method is as
      follows: Suppose we have an 8-bit memory and we want to treat
      it as an integer with sign bit.  Then we treat the 7 least
      significant bits as usual, but the 8th bit, instead of giving
      it its usual place value of 128, we simply say that if it is
      0, the number is positive, and if it is 1, the number is
      negative.  </p><p>Thus, under this scheme, 00000001 represents the number 1,
      and 10000001 represents -1.  The largest number we can
      represent is 01111111, i.e., 127, and the lowest is 11111111,
      or -127.  This should immediately raise our suspicious,
      because there are only 255 numbers between -127 and 127
      inclusive, but there are 256 different sequences of 8 bits.
      That means that under this scheme, there are two sequences of
      8 bits that represent the same number!  Stop for a minute
      and think about what these are.</p><font color="blue"><u>Click to toggle answer</u></font><br>Under this scheme 00000000 represents the number 0,
	but so too does 10000000.
	<p>Other issues with this method include the fact that the
      method for adding them is rather complex, both in terms of how
      to explain it and how to implement it with circuitry, but we'll
      leave it be for now and instead discuss the more common
      method employed in the wild:</p><p><div id="def_twos complement" class="definition"></div>The preferred method for
      representing arbitrary integers in binary is called <b>two's
      complement</b>, in which the place values are all the same
      except the most significant bit's place value is the negative
      of what it otherwise would be. In the case of 8-bit
      integers, this means that the MSB has a place value of
      -128.  Explicitly, this means that if the MSB is 0 then the
      number has the same meaning as in the non-negative case, and i
      the MSB is 1, then you determine its value by looking at the
      other bits, computing what they represent as a non-negative
      integer, and then adding -128.</p><p>For example, the numbers 00000000 (0), 00000001 (1),
      through 01111111 (127) are all the same as before, but
      10000000 then represents -128, and 10000001 is -127, all the
      way until -11111111, which is -1.  Thus we can represent any
      integer between -128 an 127 inclusive--or 256 different
      values, so there are no repetitions.  </p><p>This scheme may look odd on paper, but on top of having no
      redundancy, it will turn out that the same procedure we'll use
      to add non-negative binary numbers can also be used to add two's
      complement binary integers as well.</p></div></div><div class="section"><div id="sec_4_4_1"></div><div class="text"><div class="header">4.4.1:

    numbers).</p><br><br><b>Definitions: </b><a href="#def_fixed%20point">fixed point</a>, <a href="#def_floating%20point">floating point</a></div><p>To represent real numbers, we can take our cue from decimal
      representations: What does 12.34 mean?  The piece before the

      given reciprocal place values: 1/10, 1/100, etc.  So
      specifically, this means one 10, two 1s, three 1/10s, and four
      1/100s.  </p><p>If we're instead talking about, say, 8-bit binary numbers,
      we can declare that the point is always in a fixed place, say
      right in the middle.  So the number 11010110 represents the

      place the point in the middle, the highest number we can
      represent then becomes 270.9375.  Compared with the largest
      integer value we can store with 16 bits--65535--this is rather
      small.  So another scheme was devised--floating
      point--inspired by standard scientific notation.  To write a
      number, say 532.9, in scientific notation, you start by
      putting the point right after the first digit, so in this
      example, 5.329.  That's not the actual number, but if we
      multiply it by 10 enough times, the decimal point will move
      back to where it was supposed to be: 5.329x10<sup>2</sup>, or
      commonly, 5.329E2.  So rather than having to worry about where
      the point goes, we have effectively two pieces of information
      to keep track of: A single fixed point number (5.329), and the
      exponent, 2.  If we wanted a smaller number like .005329, all
      we have to do is change the exponent to, in this case, -3.</p><p><div id="def_floating point" class="definition"></div>In a floating point scheme, we
      use 16 bits (though there are variants for larger numbers of
      bits).  We use the first bit of these as a sign bit exactly as
      in the sign bit scheme.  The next 5 will represent an integer
      in two's complement between -16 and 15 that will serve as the
      exponent.  And because we're working in binary, this exponent
      will be the power of 2 to multiply by, rather than a power of
      10.  The remaining 10 bits will represent a fixed-point binary
      number, with the point after the first digit.</p><p>This is all explained best, perhaps, in an example: </p><div class="figure"><img src="/text/figures/4.5.fig1.png" width="400px"><div class="caption">Figure 4.5.1: The number -.0015869140625 expressed in

      bits, treated as a two's complement integer, represent the
      number -10, and the fixed-point number represented by the last
      10 bits is, in binary, 1.101, (1.625 in decimal).  So the real
      number represented is -(2<sup>-10</sup>)(1.625) =
      -.0015869140625.  </p><p>This scheme being rather complicated means that the
      procedure for adding or multiplying two such numbers is also
      quite involved.  In practice, computers that deal with real
      numbers often have a piece of dedicated hardware called a
      floating point unit (FPU) with circuitry especially for
      handling these operations.</p><div class="warning"><b>Warning: </b><p>It also bears mention that the actual scheme that your

	  <div class="code"><pre>7.625 = 2<sup>(exponent)</sup> * (base)</pre></div>

	  0 and 2, so 2<sup>(exponent)</sup> can be 8, i.e., the
	  exponent is 3.  Writing this in two's complement, we get the
	  exponent is 00011</p>

	  <p>Finally, this means the base must be 7.625/8 = 0.953125
	  represented using fixed-point with the point after the first
	  digit.  </p>

	  <p>To represent a number in fixed point, we simply work our
	  way down the place values just as we do for non-negative
	  integers.  The place values are 1, 1/2, 1/4, 1/8, 1/16, etc.
	  So we go through these in order, taking off that much if we
	  can (we will not review the meaning of this table
	  here--revisit the examples for non-negative integers if this
	  table makes no sense):</p>
	  
	  <table>
	    <tr><td>What's left?</td><td>0.953125</td><td>0.953125</td><td>0.453125</td><td>0.203125</td><td>0.078125</td><td>0.015625</td><td>0.015625</td><td>0</td></tr>
	    <tr><td>Place value</td><td>1</td><td>1/2</td><td>1/4</td><td>1/8</td><td>1/16</td><td>1/32</td><td>1/64</td><td>1/128</td></tr>

	  <p>So our base is 0111101000, our exponent is 00011, and our
	  sign bit is 0.  Thus one possible representation is
	  0000110111101000.</p>

	  <p>We remark that this is not the only representation.  The
	  reader is invited to check that 0001000011110100 is another

	<p><b>Representing a harder number using floating point:</b> </p><font color="blue"><u>How to represent

	  <p>As before, the sign bit is 0.  Because 1/3 is already
	  between 0 and 2, we can represent it as the base, and the
	  exponent can simply be 0.  </p>

	  <p>Now we need to represent this number in fixed point.  We
	  go through the same table as before:</p>
	  
	  <table>

	    <tr><td>Place value in decimal</td><td>1</td><td>0.5</td><td>0.25</td><td>0.125</td><td>0.0625</td><td>0.03125</td><td>0.015625</td><td>0.0078125</td><td>.00390625</td><td>.001953125</td></tr>

	  </table>
	  
	  <p>But at this point we've got 10 digits already for the
	  base, which is all we are allowed.  However, we didn't get
	  what was left over all the way down to 0!  So the number we
	  are representing isn't actually 1/3, but is simply as close
	  as we can get to it using a 10-bit base.  </p>
	  
	  <p>For this example, our base is 0010101010, our exponent is
	  00000, and our sign bit is 0.  Thus one possible
	  representation that is close to 1/3 is 0000000010101010.
	  But the actual value of this is only .33203125, rather than
	  0.3333333...  </p>

	  <p>This might be a little unnerving, however it shouldn't
	  come as too much of a surprise: There are only 16 bits, so
	  there are only 2<sup>16</sup> = 65536 possible fractions we
	  can represent.  However there are infinitely many fractions
	  even just between 0 and 1--for example 1/2, 1/3, 2/3, 1/4,
	  3/4, 1/5, 2/5, ...  Our scheme by definition cannot
	  represent them all if each possible sequence of bits
	  corresponds to one fraction.  1/3 is just the simplest one
	  that cannot be represented exactly by this scheme, but any
	  scheme that uses a fixed number of bits will necessarily
	  have some manifestation of the same issue.</p>

      In fact this is only about a quarter of the file, and it is
      already quite long and unwieldy.  There is a further
      representation that is both more compact than binary but is very
      easily converted to binary, called <b>hexadecimal</b>.  The idea
      is that we split every binary representation into groups of 4
      bits, and then simply translate according to the following
      table, which includes all 4-bit binary representations along
      with the numbers they represent in decimal and the new
      hexadecimal digit that corresponds to those 4-bits: </p><p><table>
	<tr><td>Decimal</td><td>0</td><td>1</td><td>2</td><td>3</td><td>4</td><td>5</td><td>6</td><td>7</td><td>8</td><td>9</td><td>10</td><td>11</td><td>12</td><td>13</td><td>14</td><td>15</td></tr>

      </table></p><p>For example, instead of 10001010111000, we can write in
      hexadecimal as 22b8 because: </p><table>
	<tr><td>4-bit section</td><td>0010</td><td>0010</td><td> 1011 </td><td>1000 </td></tr>
	<tr><td>Corresponding hexadecimal digit</td><td>2</td><td>    2</td><td>    b</td><td>    8</td></tr>
      </table><p>One feature of this scheme is that because every byte is two
      4-bit chunks, any byte can be represented neatly by two
      hexadecimal digits.</p><p>Numbers written in hexadecimal can be visually similar to
      numbers written in decimal if none of the hexadecimal digits
      happen to be a-f.  For example, the number '33' might be the
      decimal number thirty-three, or it might be the hexadecimal
      representation for the number 51.  To alleviate this, numbers
      written in hexadecimal are usually preceded by "0x".  So in
      future, unless context removes this ambiguity, we will write 33
      for the decimal number "thirty-three", and 0x33 for the
      hexadecimal representation (which turns out to represent the
      number "fifty-one").
      </p><p>While the details do not much emphasis at this point,
      hexadecimal can also be understood as another representation
      system with 16 digits: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 , a, b, c, d,
      e f, and whose place values are the powers of 16.  So 0xff
      represents the number f*16<sup>1</sup> + f*16<sup>0</sup>, where
      f is the digit representing the number 15.  So this is 15*16 +
      15 = 255.  Of course, 0xff is also in binary 11111111, which we
      already know represents the number 255.  So everything works out
      in the end.</p></div></div><div class="section"><div id="sec_4_6_1"></div><div class="text"><div class="header">4.6.1:

	  8 bits--three different meanings?</div><p>Above we described several ways of interpreting sequences of
      bits as binary numbers.  These interpretations were not inherent
      to the bits themselves: The sequence 11000110 would be 198 as an
      unsigned integer, -70 as an integer with sign bit, -58 as a
      two's complement integer, 12.375 as a fixed-point number with
      the point in the middle, and 1.546875 if considered as a
      fixed-point number with the point after the first digit.  </p><p>When a computer stores this sequence, it doesn't
      differentiate between these interpretations until it comes time
      to, say, add two numbers.  For instance, if we wanted to add 2
      to this number, then as an unsigned integer, we should get 200,
      or 11001000.  Incidentally, if we add two to this as a two's
      complement integer, we get the answer -56, which in two's
      complement is also 11001000.  On the other hand, to add two to
      the fixed-point number with the point in the middle, we get the
      answer of 14.375, represented as 11100110, whereas we cannot
      actually add 2 to the fixed-point number with the point after
      the first digit, as this cannot represent any number larger than
      11111111, or 1+127/128, or 1.9921875.  </p><p>The point is that the procedures for adding numbers vary
      according to what representation you wish to use.  So if you're
      telling the computer to add two numbers it has stored, you have
      to know how the numbers are stored and tell it to use the
      appropriate procedure for adding those two kinds of numbers.</p><p>To play around with the different possible interpretations of

      interpreting a 13-bit representation as an 8-bit integer doesn't

	    <p>We said that the same "add the digits with carrying"
	    procedure as we learned in grade school applies here too.
	    Let us then begin by remembering this procedure for adding
	    decimal numbers: To add 987 + 155, we would line up the
	    numbers:</p>

	    <table><tr><td></td><td>9</td><td>8</td><td>7</td></tr>
	    <tr><td>+</td><td>1</td><td>5</td><td>5</td></tr>
	    </table>

	    <p>Then we would add the right-most digits: 7+5 = 12, so we
	    say that the answer is 2, but we carry the 1: </p>

	    
	    <table><tr><td></td><td>9</td><td>2<sup>+1</sup></td><td>7</td></tr>
	    <tr><td>+</td><td>1</td><td>5</td><td>5</td></tr>
	    <tr><td>=</td><td></td><td></td><td>2</td></tr>
	    </table>

	    <p>Then we add the next right-most digits, along with the
	    carried 1: So we have 2+1+5 = 8.  This has no carry, so we
	    can proceed normally:</p>
	    
	    <table><tr><td></td><td>9</td><td>2<sup>+1</sup></td><td>7</td></tr>
	    <tr><td>+</td><td>1</td><td>5</td><td>5</td></tr>
	    <tr><td>=</td><td></td><td>8</td><td>2</td></tr>
	    </table>

	    <p>Finally, we are left with 9+1, which is 10, or "0, and
	    carry the 1":</p>
	    	    
	    <table><tr><td></td><td><sup>+1</sup></td><td>9</td><td>2<sup>+1</sup></td><td>7</td></tr>
	    <tr><td>+</td><td></td><td>1</td><td>5</td><td>5</td></tr>
	    <tr><td>=</td><td></td><td>0</td><td>8</td><td>2</td></tr>
	    </table>

	    <p>This final carrying created a fourth digit to add,
	    which is just 1+0 = 1.</p>

	    
	    <table><tr><td></td><td><sup>+1</sup></td><td>9</td><td>2<sup>+1</sup></td><td>7</td></tr>
	    <tr><td>+</td><td></td><td>1</td><td>5</td><td>5</td></tr>
	    <tr><td>=</td><td>1</td><td>0</td><td>8</td><td>2</td></tr>
	    </table>

	    <p>So the answer is 1082.  </p>
	    
	    <p>Crucial to this procedure was our ability to quickly
	    add single digits, e.g., 9+1 = 10, 7+5 = 12, and to
	    recognize which of these involved carrying.  The way we
	    learn how to do this is to more or less know by heart a
	    giant table of how to add individual digits:</p>

	    <table>

	    <p>In binary, the procedure is exactly the same, except
	    there are only two possible digits, so knowing how to add
	    the individual digits is way easier: 0+0 = 0, 0+1 = 1, 1+0
	    = 1, and 1+1 = 2, but remember that we are working in
	    binary, so 2 is actually represented by 10.  When we're
	    doing addition, this will be "0, and carry the 1".</p>

	    <p>So let us do the given addition problem:
	    10011011+11110001.  We set it up exactly as with the
	    decimal problem:</p>

	    
	    <table>
	      <tr><td></td><td>1</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>0</td><td>1</td><td>1</td></tr>
	      <tr><td>+</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>1</td></tr>
	      <tr><td>=</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr>
	    </table>

	    <p>Adding the right-most digits is 1+1 = 10, i.e., "0 and
	    carry the 1":</p>
	    
	    <table>
	      <tr><td></td><td>1</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>0</td><td>1<sup>+1</sup></td><td>1</td></tr>
	      <tr><td>+</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>1</td></tr>
	      <tr><td>=</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>1</td></tr>
	    </table>

	    <p>Then adding the next digits gives 1+1+0 = 10 = "0, carry
	    the 1": </p>
	    
	    <table>
	      <tr><td></td><td>1</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>0<sup>+1</sup></td><td>1<sup>+1</sup></td><td>1</td></tr>
	      <tr><td>+</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>1</td></tr>
	      <tr><td>=</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>0</td><td>1</td></tr>
	    </table>

	    <p>Adding the next digits (with the carry) is 0+1+0 = 1 with
	    no carry: </p>

	    <table>
	      <tr><td></td><td>1</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>0<sup>+1</sup></td><td>1<sup>+1</sup></td><td>1</td></tr>
	      <tr><td>+</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>1</td></tr>
	      <tr><td>=</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>1</td><td>0</td><td>1</td></tr>
	    </table>

	    <p>We proceed like this all the way down and get:</p>

	    
	    <table>
	      <tr><td></td><td>1<sup>+1</sup></td><td>0<sup>+1</sup></td><td>0<sup>+1</sup></td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>0<sup>+1</sup></td><td>1<sup>+1</sup></td><td>1</td></tr>
	      <tr><td>+</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>1</td></tr>
	      <tr><td>=</td><td>11</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>0</td><td>1</td></tr>
	    </table>

	    <p>For a final answer of 110001101.</p>

	    <p>If this procedure were happening inside a computer,
	    i.e., with bytes, then this answer wouldn't actually fit in
	    a memory space!  What the computer would do in this case
	    is not store the highest bit in the memory, so the answer
	    would be just 10001101, and then elsewhere it would record
	    the most significant bit of the answer.  </p>

	    <p>This is a fundamental fact about using
	    computers--memories always have fixed width.  If the
	    memories are bytes, then they can only store numbers
	    0-255.  In this case, we are adding the numbers 155+241,
	    whose answer is much larger than 255 so it doesn't fit in
	    a byte.  So the computer would store the least significant
	    8 bits of the answer: 10001101, or 141, and would store
	    the most significant bit, which didn't fit, in a special
	    location (the "status register", as we shall learn
	    later).</p>
	  <p><b>Adding integers:</b> </p><font color="blue"><u>Add the 8-bit two's complement binary

	    <p>We said that the addition procedures for two's
	    complement and for unsigned binary representations are
	    actually exactly the same, so we run through exactly the
	    same procedure as above:</p>

	    <table>

	      <tr><td>=</td><td>10</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>0</td><td>0</td></tr>
	    </table>

	    <p>For a final answer of 100011100.</p>
	    
	    <p>To consider whether this makes sense, let us think
	    about these binary representations in decimal: 00101011 is
	    43, and 11110001 is -15.  The answer is 100011100, but
	    remember that the only thing that gets stored is the last
	    8 bits, or 00011100, which represent the number 28.  So in
	    fact this is the correct answer for the problem 43+(-15).
	    </p>
	  <p><b>Negating integers:</b> </p><font color="blue"><u>Compute the negative of the 8-bit two's complement

	    <p>We said that the procedure for negating a two's
	    complement representation was to first flip all the 0s to 1s and
	    1s to 0s, and then to add 1 to the result.  When we flip
	    all the bits, we get 11000011.  Then adding 1 to this is </p>

	    <table>
	      <tr><td></td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0<sup>+1</sup></td><td>1<sup>+1</sup></td><td>1</td></tr>

	    </table>

	    <p>For a final answer of 11000100.</p>
	    
	    <p>As a sanity check, 00111100 represents the number 60,
	    and 11000100 represents (also as an 8-bit two's complement
	    representation) -60, exactly as we'd have hoped.  </p>
	  <p><b>Subtracting integers:</b> </p><font color="blue"><u>Subtract the two binary

	    <p>We know how to add signed representations and we know
	    how to negate, so all we should have to do is negate
	    00000011 and then add that to 10011110.  So off we go:
	    </p>

	    <p>We first flip all the bits: 11111100, and then we add
	    1:</p>
	    
	    <table>

	      <tr><td>=</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>0</td><td>1</td></tr>
	    </table>

	    <p>Which conveniently happens to involve no carries for
	    this particular example.  </p>

	    <p>Next we simply perform the usual addition procedure on
	    10011110 + 11111101: </p>

	    <table>
	      <tr><td> </td><td>1<sup>+1</sup></td><td>0<sup>+1</sup></td><td>0<sup>+1</sup></td><td>1<sup>+1</sup></td><td>1<sup>+1</sup></td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>0</td></tr>

	    </table>

	    <p>So the answer should be the least significant 8 bits of
	    this: 10011011.  As a sanity check, the original problem
	    was 158 - 3 and the answer we've come out with is indeed
	    155.  Huzzah!</p>
	  <p><b>Concatenating integers:</b> </p><font color="blue"><u>Compute 34:209</u></font><br>

	    11010001.  The concatenation of these is then formed by
	    just placing them one after the other to form a 16-bit
	    number: 0010001011010001.  This represents the number
	    8913.</p>

	    <p>As advertised, this is computed successfully by the

	  Boolean operations</div><div class="summary"><b>Summary: </b>We sometimes want to think of individual bits as
    true/false indicators rather than as digits of a larger binary
    number.  When we do this, we can perform logical operations like
    "and" and "or" on individual bits.  These are called "boolean
    operations".<br><br><b>Definitions: </b><a href="#def_boolean%20logic">boolean logic</a>, <a href="#def_truth%20table">truth table</a></div><p>There is a further way to think about sequences of bits,
      namely by thinking about each individual bit separately, rather
      than as some part of a larger number.  An individual bit on its
      own can only either be 0 or 1, of course, so we can and often
      will think of it as representing a truth value--0 being "false"
      and 1 being "true".  Then a sequence of 8 bits can simply
      describe the truth of 8 separate assertions; for example 11000100 means
      that assertions 1, 2, and 6 are true and the rest are false.
      </p><p><div id="def_boolean logic" class="definition"></div>This perspective is called
      <b>boolean logic</b>, and it has its own set of operations that
      we will now discuss.</p><p><b>AND: </b> For instance, if I have information about the
      truth of two statements--statement A and statement B, I can
      inquire about the combined statement "A is true and B is also
      true".  If I have two bits, one for each of my statements, then
      I can perform the AND operation to get the truth value of the
      combined statement.  This operation is generally denoted by the
      symbol "&amp;", and for two bits x and y, the value of x &amp; y
      is "true" (i.e., 1) if both x and y are true (i.e., 1), and
      "false" (0) otherwise.</p><p><div id="def_truth table" class="definition"></div>It is common to see such operations
      described with a table like so, called a <b>truth table</b>:
    

    <table><tr><td>x</td><td>y</td><td>x &amp; y</td></tr>
    <tr><td>0</td><td>0</td><td><b>0</b></td></tr>
    <tr><td>0</td><td>1</td><td><b>0</b></td></tr>
    <tr><td>1</td><td>0</td><td><b>0</b></td></tr>
    <tr><td>1</td><td>1</td><td><b>1</b></td></tr>
    </table>

    So, for example, 0 &amp; 1 can be read off from the first column
      and second row of this table as being 0.</p><p>There are four boolean logic operations that we wish to
      describe here (though there are of course as many operations as
      there are truth tables you can write down): "and", "or", "xor",
      and "not".  We just discussed "and"</p><p><b>OR: </b> This operation is written with a vertical "pipe"
      character: |, and corresponds to asking whether it's true that
      either statement A is true or statement B is true.  This
      combined statement is of course true provided at least one of
      statement A or statement B is true.  This manifests as saying
      that x | y is 1 if either x is 1 or y is 1, and 0 otherwise.
      This gives the truth table:
      

      <table><tr><td>x</td><td>y</td><td>x | y</td></tr>
      <tr><td>0</td><td>0</td><td><b>0</b></td></tr>
      <tr><td>0</td><td>1</td><td><b>1</b></td></tr>
      <tr><td>1</td><td>0</td><td><b>1</b></td></tr>
      <tr><td>1</td><td>1</td><td><b>1</b></td></tr>
      </table>
      </p><p><b>XOR: </b> Closely related to OR, the XOR or "exclusive-or"
      operation is written with a "caret" character: ^ (not to be
      confuse with the same character's occasional use to denote
      exponentiation), and corresponds to asking whether it's true
      that either statement A is true or statement B is true, <i>but
      not both</i>.  This combined statement is true provided exactly
      one of statement A or statement B is true.  This manifests as
      saying that x ^ y is 1 if x and y have opposite values, and 0
      otherwise.  This gives the truth table:
      

      <table><tr><td>x</td><td>y</td><td>x ^ y</td></tr>
      <tr><td>0</td><td>0</td><td><b>0</b></td></tr>
      <tr><td>0</td><td>1</td><td><b>1</b></td></tr>
      <tr><td>1</td><td>0</td><td><b>1</b></td></tr>
      <tr><td>1</td><td>1</td><td><b>0</b></td></tr>
      </table>
      </p><p><b>NOT: </b>Unlike the previous operations, which operated on
      two bits, the not operation operates on a single bit and simply
      flips its value to be the opposite of what it was before.  NOT
      of a bit called x is written ~x, and can be described with a
      very simple "truth table" thus:
      
      <table><tr><td>x</td><td>~x</td></tr>
      <tr><td>0</td><td><b>1</b></td></tr>
      <tr><td>1</td><td><b>0</b></td></tr>
      </table>
      </p><p>Computers rarely work on single bits at a time, however.  So
      in practice, we can extend these operations to acting on whole
      bytes at a time instead of individual bits by saying that to
      take two bytes x and y and compute x &amp; y, we simply compute
      the "and" of the first bits and make that the first bit of the
      answer.  Then compute the AND of the second bits and make that
      the second bit of the answer, and so on.  </p><p>There are a few operations that act on sequences of bits
      while still treating them as boolean values: The "shift left"
      (written &gt;&gt; 1) and "shift right" (&lt;&lt; 1) operators simply
      take all the bits and shift them one slot to the right or left
      (respectively).  </p><p>So, for example, 11000110 &gt;&gt; 1 = 01100011 and 11000110
      &lt;&lt; 1 = 10001100.</p></div></div><div class="section"><div id="sec_4_9_1"></div><div class="text"><div class="header">4.9.1:

The first trick is to left shift instead of multiplying by 2. This trick is related to the fact that every digit in the binary number represents a different power of 2, and you could make a similar conclusion about left-shifting decimal numbers. Write the binary and decimal values of each number below to see how binary and decimal are related to this left-shift trick:
<p>00000001</p>
<p>00000010</p>
<p>00000100</p>
<p>00001000</p>
