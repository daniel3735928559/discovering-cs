(low-level programming will happen at the ISA
layer).</div></div><p>Let us start by situating ourselves within the tower of
abstractions we laid out in the previous chapter: We are trying to
understand computers--that is, devices that perform arithmetic,
logical, memory, and I/O operations.  Specifically, we are trying to
understand two things: </p><ul><li>How to program a computer</li>
<li>How to build a computer</li></ul><p>Recall we said that to program such a device, we would provide it
with sequences of commands from its ISA.  But because the ISA provides
only basic commands, we prefer to write commands in a more
human-friendly form and then have a mechanical way of translating
those commands into the basic ISA commands that the computer
understands.  A human-friendly way of specifying what the computer
should do is called a <b>high-level programming language</b>.  </p><div class="warning"><b>Warning: </b><p>The computer doesn't itself understand the programming
language, as mentioned.  However at this level, we are actually not
interacting directly with the computer at all, but rather with the
compiler--the mechanism for translating a high-level programming
language into ISA operations for the computer's consumption.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, we may sometimes in this chapter speak imprecisely by
talking about the computer itself actually understanding the
programming language, when really we mean the compiler--the
abstraction currently sitting between us and the computer--is helping
the computer understand it.  That is, we are describing the interface
of the compiler, and so from this perspective, programming the
compiler looks like programming the computer.</p>
</div><p>In this chapter, we'll discuss the concept of a program and a
programming language in general in 2.2, as well as strategies for
writing effective programs.  Then, starting in 2.3, we'll introduce an
actual programming language: Python, and will walk through the process
of writing Python programs to solve specified problems.  </p><p><div id="def_programming" class="definition"></div>Most generally, <b>programming</b> is expressing to the computer: 
<ul><li>A sequence of steps for it to perform--also known as a <b>program</b></li>
<li>specified in way that the computer understands--also known as a <b>programming language</b></li></ul>


<div id="def_executing" class="definition"></div>When the computer subsequently executes the steps you gave it, it is
said to be <b>running</b> or <b>executing</b> the program.  </p><p>In general, you approach a computer with a human-level problem: You want to find out how much you spend on cookies each month, or maybe you want to make a Pacman clone.  However a computer has no understanding of such things--It does not know what a cookie is and does not come with a command for "play pacman".  But it does (at least, at the level we're thinking about it currently) provide you with a programming language--that is, you can tell it to do certain specific operations that are allowed by the language.  Beyond that, a computer is a machine--if you give it a sequence of commands in a programming language, it very simply does everything listed in that program, and nothing else.  It has no understanding of--let alone sympathy for--its owner's 'intent'.  </p><div class="code"><pre>A classic parable--"If your husband were a computer": 

"Honey, while you're out, could you stop by the store and buy one
carton of milk?  And if they have eggs, get 6."  

A short time later the husband comes back with 6 cartons of milk.

The wife is perplexed.  "Why did you buy 6 cartons of milk?"

"They had eggs!"</pre></div><p>This is the gap that a programmer has to bridge: Taking a high-level problem coming from the real world, and turning it into a sequence of steps that are allowed in a given programming language.  </p><p>In this chapter, we'll do three things: 

<ol><li>In 2.2, we'll discuss the first step in crossing this gap: Algorithms.  An algorithm is a human-readable description of computer-friendly steps intended to solve a high-level problem.  There are a few considerations that come into play when designing an algorithm--how "good" is a particular algorithm for solving a problem, and what does "good" even mean for algorithms.  </li>

<li>Then, in 2.3, and 2.4, we'll take the next step: Once we've got the algorithm--the computer-friendly steps that solve the problem--we need the program.  That is, we need to write those steps in a computer-friendly way.  So we'll introduce a specific programming language--Python, talking only about the rules about what instructions are allowed in a valid Python program (also known as Python's syntax, and discussed in 2.4), and what specific valid instructions actually do (Python's semantics, discussed in 2.5).  </li>

<li>Finally, in 2.5 and 2.6, we'll go through examples of ever-increasing complexity that put this whole process together: Starting with a general problem, constructing an algorithm that solves it in a computer's terms, and then turning that algorithm into a program so that the computer can find the actual solutions for us.  </li></ol></p></div></div><div class="section"><div id="sec_2_2"></div><div class="text"><div class="header">2.2: 
	  Algorithms: Expressing solutions in human language, but in terms of the computer's primitives</div><div class="summary"><b>Summary: </b><p>The first step in programming a computer with the
    solution to some given problem is to figure out what are the steps
    it will need to perform.  Each step must consist, fundamentally,
    of only operations of the four basic sorts that a computer can
    perform.  </p>

    <p>It is at this point--while writing the algorithm and in
    particular before writing any actual computer code--that we can
    assess our solution's efficiency as well as identify in what
    situations our solution would not work.  This can consist either
    of rare special cases of the problem in question--called
    edge-cases, or of simply scaling up the size of the problem until
    our solution wouldn't be able to handle it within a reasonable
    amount of time.</p></div><p>Suppose you've written a computer game, which has 3 players,
      each of whom has a score.  At the game's end, you'd like to
      determine a winner.  To a human, looking at the three scores and
      picking out the largest one is completely straightforward.
      After all, "pick the largest of three numbers" seems like an
      atomic operation in its own right--one which we never have to
      think about breaking down into a more precise, step-by-step
      procedure.</p><p>However such a step-by-step procedure is exactly what a computer needs in order to accomplish this same goal.  It doesn't have a "find the largest number" operation built-in.  Instead, its available operations are basic: Things like "add two numbers", "compare two numbers", and the like.  </p><p>First of all, we know the computer can store numbers.  In fact, as we will see later, you can store numbers under names of your choosing, so suppose we've stored the three players' scores under the names score1, score2, and score3 respectively.  Then a procedure for determining the winner might look like: </p><div class="code"><pre>If score1 is greater than score2 and score1 is also
greater than score3: Display the text: "PLAYER 1 WINS!"

If not, then if score2 is greater than score1 and score2 is also
greater than score3: Display the text: "PLAYER 2 WINS!"

If not, then if score3 is greater than score1 and score3 is also
greater than score2: Display the text: "PLAYER 3 WINS!"
</pre></div><div class="code_caption">An algorithm for determining the winner of a 3-player game given
the scores</div><p>This procedure can now believably be broken down into simple arithmetic operations: Comparing two numbers is an operation the computer can do, and the simple logic operation "if both this and that are true" is another, so indeed, the above does comprise a computer-friendly procedure.  It is not yet a program because it was still written in English, rather than in a language the computer understands, but it is a complete description of computer-friendly steps for accomplishing what we need done.  Recall that such a precisely specified procedure we called an algorithm.  </p><p>There are two things that might give you pause about this algorithm as written:  namely, it's handling of ties, and its apparent inefficiency.  </p></div></div><div class="section"><div id="sec_2_2_1"></div><div class="text"><div class="header">2.2.1: 
	  Edge-cases</div><div class="summary"><b>Summary: </b>Edge-cases are situations that are unusual or
      unexpected, but may nonetheless occur.  A simple example of this
      is a tied score in a game.  Sloppy algorithms may work under
      normal circumstances but break down when faced with certain
      edge-cases.<br><br><b>Definitions: </b><a href="#def_edge-case">edge-case</a></div><p>When you sit down to write an algorithm, you should have
	some understanding of what you can and cannot expect of the
	inputs.  For instance, try to follow through the above
	algorithm if <div class="code"><pre>score1 = 10, score2 = 10, score3 = 7</pre></div>
	It doesn't print anything at all!  <div id="def_edge-case" class="definition"></div>Such
	inputs are sometimes called <b>corner-cases</b> or
	<b>edge-cases</b>.  They are not generally what your algorithm
	will have to deal with, but they can still happen in theory,
	and when they do, they can give you a rather bad day if you
	haven't accounted for them. Indeed, failing to deal with
	even a single sneaky corner-case is a common cause of serious
	problems in real-world programming.</p><p>For now, for simplicity, we'll assume the rest of the game
	is set up so that any tie is resolved with a tie-breaker, so
	that in fact, by the time the algorithm above is run, there
	are no remaining ties.  </p><p>This is one perfectly valid way of dealing with
	corner-cases: Just add some further steps that ensure that
	they can honestly never appear.  This decision comes from
	asking the higher-level question of how we in fact want the
	game to work.  If we really don't want there to be ties in the
	end (e.g., we always make it so there are tiebreaker rounds
	until all ties are resolved), then we may do as we suggested.
	But if we actually think ties should be a valid result in our
	game, then we would have to expand our score-comparison
	algorithm to deal with this and detect them.</p></div></div><div class="section"><div id="sec_2_2_2"></div><div class="text"><div class="header">2.2.2: 
	  Efficiency</div><div class="summary"><b>Summary: </b>Simply having an algorithm that solves the given
      problem isn't the end of the story.  We can ask whether there is
      a more "efficient" algorithm, where "efficient" may mean
      anything from "takes less time to finish in every situation" to
      "requires more storage space to finish in some cases, but
      requires way less storage in the few cases we actually expect to
      run into".  <br><br><b>Definitions: </b><a href="#def_efficiency">efficiency</a></div><p>There are two things about this algorithm's inefficiency
	that might offend your sensibilities: We're comparing three
	numbers, so it seems like the number of actual "compare these
	two numbers" operations required shouldn't be too many.  But
	indeed, if score3 happens to be the largest number, then the
	above algorithm will perform this operation 6 times: </p><p>We first compared score1 to score2 and then to score3.
	Since score1 wasn't the largest, we then compared score2 to
	score1 and to score3.  Since score2 was also not the largest,
	we finally compared score3 to score1 and to score2, and saw
	that score3 was indeed larger than the other two.  This
	intuitively seems a lot more work than your brain is likely
	doing when you simply look at three numbers and spot the
	largest by eye, so it might be worth looking for an improved
	algorithm that will involve less work from the computer.  </p><p>By contrast, consider the following algorithm: </p><div class="code"><pre>If score1 &gt; score2, then do the following: If score1 &gt; score3,
Display "Player 1 wins", or else display "Player 3 wins!"

Otherwise, do the following: If score2 &gt; score3, Display "Player 2
wins", or else display "Player 3 wins!"</pre></div><div class="code_caption">A slightly more
efficient algorithm for comparing three scores</div><p>This algorithm has three comparisons written into it, but it will
only ever perform two of them regardless of what the scores are,
making it three times as fast as the original algorithm, at least in
the event that player 3 wins.  </p><p>(As an aside: It is worth revisiting the question of edge-cases
with this improved algorithm, and noting that while our previous
algorithm printed nothing in case of a tie, this one may actively
print the wrong thing--try it and see!)</p><p><div id="def_efficiency" class="definition"></div>This is an example of analyzing an
algorithm's <b>efficiency</b>--that is, analyzing how much of a given
resource an algorithm may require under various circumstances.
That definition is intentionally quite vague: "Resources" may refer to
time, or memory, or communication bandwidth, or money, or any other
thing required by the algorithm that we may wish to study.  "Various
circumstances" may refer to asking about how the algorithm behaves in
the most common case, or in the average case, or in the worst possible
case.  </p><p>Which notion of efficiency you consider in your algorithm design
depends on circumstances usually outside the original problem
statement--do you have lots of money and no time?  An algorithm that
is highly inefficient in its use of memory even in the common case,
but very efficient in its use of time, even in the worst case, may be
what you want.</p><p>The conclusion that we arrived at in our comparison of the two "who
won?" algorithms, stated precisely, would be that they require the
same amount of memory (both have to store exactly three values), but
that in the worst case, the first algorithm would require six
comparisons to be performed whereas the second would require only
two.</p><div class="warning"><b>Warning: </b><p> Even our mention of "time" as a resource was a little
imprecise.  Remember that when a computer runs a program, what it is
actually doing is running ISA operations.  Generally, each ISA
operation takes a fixed number of microseconds, so to study how long a
program takes, we technically have to understand what ISA operations
it corresponds to and ask how many of these will be executed.</p>

<p>Counting the number of steps or arithmetic operations used by the
algorithm is often a useful proxy for this more precise notion, but as
you get more involved with high-level languages, the more
disassociated "number of steps in your program" becomes from "number
of ISA operations involved".  If we wish to make our programs more
efficient, then, it can be crucial to understand them at the ISA
level.  We will see examples of this in chapter 5.  </p></div></div></div><div class="section"><div id="sec_2_2_3"></div><div class="text"><div class="header">2.2.3: 
	  Scalability</div><div class="summary"><b>Summary: </b>If we take our algorithm that solves a problem and
      become very successful, sometimes we end up facing a much bigger
      version of our original problem.  Maybe our game only had three
      players to begin with, but what if it becomes popular and now
      has a million?  This is another measure of an algorithm--how
      well it behaves when faced with larger and larger versions of
      the problem it was meant to solve.  In other words, how well it
      "scales."<br><br><b>Definitions: </b><a href="#def_scalability">scalability</a></div><p>There is a related but more subtle concern about the original
algorithm, which is: Suppose instead we had 10 players?  Or 100?  What
would it look like then?  </p><p>The structure of the algorithm was:</p><div class="code"><pre>First do all the comparisons to see if player 1 won.

If player 1 didn't win, then do all the comparisons to see if player 2
won.

etc.</pre></div><p>So in the case of 10 players, it looks like:</p><div class="code"><pre>If score1 &gt; score2 and score1 &gt; score3 and ... and score1 &gt;
score10, then display "Player 1 wins!"

Otherwise, if score2 &gt; score1 and score2 &gt; score3 and ...

..............</pre></div><p>Before, if player 3 won, we had to do 6 whole comparisons to find this out.  Now there are 10 players who might have won, and testing each requires 9 comparisons, so we get a total of 90 comparisons that might have to happen before we can determine a winner!  In general, for N players, we have N*(N-1) comparisons--so for 100 players, that's 9900 comparisons!</p><p>These numbers might seem notionally problematic, but it is possible
to assess the actual cost in time and energy to say something
objective: An average computer might say it is "clocked at a 1 GHz".
That means it can do a one billion basic operations every second.  If
you're running a massively multiplayer online game with 10000 players,
then using this algorithm, each winner calculation will take at least
99990000, or roughly one hundred million operations.  With a 1 GHz
computer, we can thus only compute a winner around 10 times per
second.  And if we want to constantly be displaying the current leader
on the screen as the game progresses, this means the game can only
update the display 10 times per second at most (i.e., run the game at
10 "frames per second").  But the illusion of smoothness in gameplay
comes from updating the picture on the screen at the very least 30
times per second, so limiting a game to 10 frames per second would
result in noticeable stuttering and could easily render the game
unplayable.  </p><p><div id="def_scalability" class="definition"></div>This is an analysis of
<b>scalability</b>--that is, of questions about how well the algorithm
performs when we apply it to scaled-up versions of the same problem,
and about how big the problem can become before we are forced to
modify our algorithm to solve it effectively.</p><p>Whether scalability is a concern for your particular application is
again more a question of your philosophy, ambitions, and external
constraints.  If you're really honestly only ever going to have three
players, then reducing 6 operations to 2 on a computer that can
perform billions every second, and putting a lot of effort in to make
your program works for thousands of people at a time when that scale
is very far in your project's future may or may not be the best use of
your time right at the start of such a project.  </p></div></div><div class="section"><div id="sec_2_3"></div><div class="text"><div class="header">2.3:

      simulator, which will be included in-line.  Press run to start
      running the program.  Press "step" to advance the program by one
      step.  Change the number in the box next to "step" to make the
      "step" button advance the program by more steps.  The link on
      the left sidebar will let you run a more complete version of the
      simulator.</div><p>Python is a real-world programming language with many uses
	in the wild.  In this chapter, however, since we're focusing
	on a very small part of the Python language, we will not run
	any code on a real computer.  Rather, we will use the web
	browser to simulate the code being run.  This way, we will get
	to watch what happens, as if in slow-motion, as the code is
	executed, rather than it all happening at once and trying to
	work out or imagine what happened afterward.  </p><p>We'll explain the use of the simulator interface and what
	you can do with it throughout this section, but if you're the
	sort of person who would rather play the game without first
	reading the rules, a few example programs and challenges are
	available by clicking the "Python" link on the sidebar, or by
	clicking <a href="sim/py/python.html">here</a>.  </p><p>To use the simulator, you write your program in the text
	box on the right.  When ready, click the "run" button above
	it, whereupon the simulation will be prepared.  At this point,
	no changes to the code can be made until you press the "reset"
	button.  To execute a single line of code, click the "step"
	button.  If you want to run more than one step at a time,
	simply enter how many steps you want the step button to
	advance into the input box to the right of it.  </p><p>As you step through the code, the line that will be
	executed the next time you step is highlighted in the program
	text input by a red arrow that will appear next to that line
	in the left-hand margin.</p><p>While you can write and test any program in this simulator,
	some programs right here in the main text will be embedded in
	a smaller version of the simulator so you can step through the
	examples and see how they work and edit them as you please to
	see how various changes affect the behavior.  You can always
	restore the original example program by pressing the "original"

	  A first Python example</div><div class="summary"><b>Summary: </b>We introduce Python by describing a classical
      mathematics problem, writing an algorithm, and then writing the
      corresponding Python code for that algorithm.<br><br><b>Definitions: </b><a href="#def_modulus">modulus</a></div><p>There is a famous mathematical problem--known as the 3x+1
	conjecture--that goes as follows: 

<ol><li>Start with any positive integer.  </li>
<li>If it is even, divide it by 2.  If odd, triple it and add one.
</li>
<li>If the result is 1, stop.  Otherwise, go back to the previous
step.</li>
</ol>

For example, we start with 5:</p><table>
<tr><td>Current value</td><td>What do we do next?</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>5 is odd, so triple and add 1 to get...</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>16 is even, so divide by 2</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>8 is even, so divide by 2</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>4 is even, so divide by 2</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>2 is even, so divide by 2</td></tr>
<tr><td>1</td><td></td></tr>
</table><p>The conjecture is that we always get down to 1, regardless of our
start input.  We just verified the conjecture starting with x = 5, but
what about other values of x?  We can start doing some, and it's
pretty easy: For x = 25, for example, it goes: 

<div class="code"><pre>25, 76, 38, 19, 58, 29, 88, 44, 22, 11, 34, 17, 52, 26, 13, 40,
20, 10, 5, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1</pre></div>

It takes a little while, but we can sort of do it by hand.  However,
for x = 27, if we start, we get the sequence:

<div class="code"><pre>27, 82, 41, 124, 62, 31, 94, 47, 142, 71, 214, 107, 322, 161,
484, 242, 121, 364, 182, 91, 274, 137, 412, 206, 103, 310, 155, 466,
233, 700, 350, 175, 526, 263, 790, 395, 1186, ......</pre></div>

Which looks like it might possibly continue with its fitful growth
forever.  If only we could get a computer to do the tedious work of
running the algorithm for us...</p><p>As described before, the first step in writing a program is to come
up with an algorithm that expresses the procedure in terms of the
kinds of operations a computer can do.  </p><div class="code"><pre>
1. Store the value 27 in a slot called x (Storage)
2. See if x is equal to 1, and as long as it is not, execute the
   following steps (3-5) and come back to this step:  (Arithmetic and branching)
   3. If x is even, compute x/2 and store that in x (Arithmetic, storage, and branching)
   4. Otherwise, compute 3*x+1 and store that in x (Arithmetic, storage, and branching)
   5. Print out the current value of x (I/O)
6. Print out the text "Done" (I/O)
</pre></div><p>We call step 3 ("If x is even...") partly arithmetic because we
compute x/2, and partly storage because we have to store that
somewhere, and partly branching because it's choosing to either
execute a computation or to skip it depending on a certain condition.
However, testing that condition--whether x is even--doesn't seem like
an arithmetic operation in the sense of addition, subtraction,
multiplication, and division.  </p><p>The key is that division is actually three separate operations:
Just as in grade school, before you learned to think of 13 divided by
4 as 3.25, you may have instead learned it as "13 divided by 4 is 3
with a remainder of 1".  That is, 4 goes into 13 three times, but then
there's one left over.</p><p>In Python, the "/" operation represents the decimal division--so 13
/ 4 is 3.25.  <div id="def_modulus" class="definition"></div>The "%" operation performs integer
division and gives back not the quotient, but the remainder.  So 13 %
4 is 1, because 4 goes 3 times into 13, with a remainder of 1.  This
operator is known as the <b>modulus</b> operator.</p><div class="aside"><b>Aside: </b><p>In case you're wondering where this word "modulus" comes
from--it actually comes from an English word "modulo", meaning roughly
"supposing we ignore".  For example, "Bob and Sam basically get along
quite well modulo matters pertaining to cheese".  The reason for its
use here is that 13 = 1 + 4 + 4 + 4, so modulo 4s--i.e. if we ignore
the 4s, 13 is the same as 1.  I.e. "13 modulo 4 is 1", written in
computer lingo as 13 % 4 = 1.</p>
</div><p>The modulus operator gives us a way to test whether a number is
even: "Even" means that when you divide by 2, there is a remainder of
0.  So to test whether x is even, we'll compute x % 2.  If this is 0,
then x is even.  Otherwise, x is odd.  For simplicity, we'll break out
this computation into a separate step in the algorithm: </p><div class="code"><pre>Store the value 27 in a slot called x (Storage)
See if x is equal to 1, and as long as it is not, execute the
following steps and come back to this step:  (Arithmetic and branching)
   Compute x % 2 and store it in a slot called y (Arithmetic and storage)
   If y is 0, do the following steps: (Branching)
      Compute x/2 and store that in x (Arithmetic and storage)
   Otherwise, do the following steps: (Branching)
      Compute 3*x+1 and store that in x (Arithmetic and storage)
   Print out the current value of x (I/O)
Print out the text "Done" (I/O)
</pre></div><p>Now, we said that programming is taking an algorithm and expressing
it in a computer's terms.  To this end, we shall take the above
algorithm and write a Python program that runs it (don't worry if you
don't understand it yet--all will be explained in time): </p><div class="code"><pre>x = 27
while(x != 1):
   y = x % 2
   if(y == 0):
      x = x / 2
   else:
      x = 3 * x + 1
   print(x)
print("Done")
</pre></div><p>Before we jump into studying this program, let's run it to see what
happens: To start the program, press the "run" button.  Then to
advance to the next step in the program, one step at a time, press the
"step" button.  It will of course take a long time of doing this to
run the program through to completion, so we can use the box next to
the step button to say how many steps we want the step button to
advance us.  If you want to see the end result, put something large
like 1000 in and wait and behold the output.  </p><p>Now, if you compare this listing to the English language algorithm,
you notice many similarities, but the Python syntax is more rigid: The
computer runs this program by the code one line at a time.  After one
line is run, it moves on to the next line, unless some instruction
tells it to do otherwise.  </p><p>This is a fundamental rule, and should be internalized so you can
get used to understanding programs mechanically: Programs are run one
line at a time.  In particular, understanding a program entails not so
much looking at it as a whole, but understanding what each line does
individually.  Generally, once one line's instruction is completed,
the next instruction to be run is the one on the following line,
except in certain situations in which an instruction can tell the
program to jump to a different line.  For example, the block:
</p><div class="code"><pre>x = 27
<div class="highlight">while(x != 1):
   y = x % 2
   if(y == 0):
      x = x / 2
   else:
      x = 3 * x + 1
   print(x)</div>print("Done!")
</pre></div><p>means that all the indented instructions should be repeated as long
as x is not 1 (which is written in Python as x != 1).  In particular,
when we get to the line </p><div class="code"><pre>x = 27
while(x != 1):
   y = x % 2
   if(y == 0):
      x = x / 2
   else:
      x = 3 * x + 1
<div class="highlight">   print(x)</div>print("Done!")
</pre></div><p>if x still isn't 1, then we don't go to the next line (which is the end of the program!), but instead jump back to the beginning of the indented "while" block--specifically, to the line </p><div class="code"><pre>x = 27
while(x != 1):
<div class="highlight">   y = x % 2</div>   if(y == 0):
      x = x / 2
   else:
      x = 3*x+1
   print(x)
print("Done!")
</pre></div><p>There is a second difference between the English description of the
algorithm and its programmatic realization, namely that whereas when
describing the algorithm, we had a notion of "the current value of the
number", which in the example took on the values "5, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1".
In the program, we have to give the value a name.  In this program, we
have chosen the name "x".  Such a "named value" is called a variable.
Variables are used whenever we want to store the value of a
computation for later use.</p><p>In this program, we have two variables, called "x" and "y", whose stored values get updated as the program progresses.  </p><p>Using the rule that a program is run one line at a time, we can
follow along with the program, one line at a time, to see: 
<ol><li>Which lines get executed</li>
<li>What values the variables are storing</li></ol></p><table>

	  Python language summary</div><p>We now present a brief summary of all of Python as we'll
	use it in this chapter.  This includes a specification of the
	syntax--the rules that define what is allowed as Python code,
	and the semantics--what the various valid constructs do.  </p><p>The way this specification works is recursive: For example,
	we will first specify that Python code is run one line at a
	time.  So to do something in Python, we have to write a
	sequence of lines.  So then the question is: What is a line?
	In the table below, we see that a line is either an
	'assignment line', 'print line', or a 'flow-control' line.  </p><p>We haven't said what any of these are yet, but behold, they
	show up later in the table!  The table tells us that
	assignment lines are used for computation and for setting
	variables, print lines are for printing things, and
	flow-control lines are for deciding which line to execute
	next.  </p><p>So if we now decide that what we want is to store some
	number in a variable, then we look at the specification for an
	assignment line, since that seems the thing for the job.  It
	says that an assignment line looks like: 

	<div class="code"><pre><i>variable name</i> = <i>expression</i></pre></div>

	We haven't said what variable names or expressions are, but
	they are also described in the table!</p><p>Looking further down to variable names, we see that a
	variable name can be anything with letters, numbers, and
	underscores, but not starting with a number, and not a Python
	keyword.  So we can decide to call our variable, say, 
	<span class="icode">H3LL0_th3re_</span>.  </p><p>But what about the expression bit?  Expressions are defined
	in the table as any valid combination of numbers, strings, and
	variables using the basic operations and parentheses for
	grouping.  So if we want to store the value 89*90, we can do
	this like: 

	<div class="code"><pre>H3LL0_th3re_ = 89*90</pre></div>

	And the fact that we have followed the table tells us that
	this is a valid assignment line which will store the value of
	the expression 89*90--i.e., the number 8010--into a variable
	called H3LL0_th3re_.</p></div></div><div class="section"><div id="sec_2_4"></div><div class="text"><div class="header">2.4:

      confirming that it follows all the rules: The syntax tree.<br><br><b>Definitions: </b><a href="#def_syntax%20tree">syntax tree</a></div><p>Before we dive too deep into explaining Python, we
	reiterate that while the most interesting part of any
	programming task is always deciding how to match the code to
	the problem, your code must first always conform to proper
	Python syntax or it will not do anything at all.  Happily,
	ensuring proper syntax in your Python is very much the easy
	part, and doesn't even require you to think about or even know
	what your code does.  Much as you can probably tell that the
	phrase "Begone you ancephelous lummox!" is valid English,
	whereas "Accismus very kerfuffle the, bromnopnea in" is not,
	even without knowing the meaning of many of the words
	involved, you do not need to understand Python semantics in
	order to tackle its syntax.</p><p><div id="def_syntax tree" class="definition"></div>To better understand the syntax, we
	will introduce another way of visualizing it, called a
	<b>syntax tree</b>.  This is a visualization that highlights
	the relationships between the syntax elements.   The
	most fundamental syntax element is a line of code: The program is
	entirely comprised of lines.  But what is a line allowed to
	be?  Well, there are three choices: Assignment lines, print
	lines, and flow-control lines.  </p><div class="figure"><img src="/text/figures/2.4.1.fig1.png" width="800px"><div class="caption">Figure 2.4.1.1: The start of the Python syntax tree</div></div><p>But the description of the assignment lines includes some
	further terminology that needs to be explained: What is a
	variable name?  What is an expression?  And for flow-control
	lines, what is a test?  So to complete the syntax tree, we
	extend it with the descriptions of these things as well, taken
	from the table: </p><div class="figure"><img src="/text/figures/2.4.1.fig2.png" width="800px"><div class="caption">Figure 2.4.1.2: The full syntax tree for Python</div></div><p>To see how this works, let us take an example program:</p><div class="code"><pre>x = 2
if(x &lt; 2):
   print("Hi")
if(x &gt;= 2):
   print("Bye")
x = 5 + x</pre></div><p>First of all, of course this consists of lines.  But
	further, each line is one of the three types of line:</p><div class="figure"><img src="/text/figures/2.4.1.fig3.png" width="500px"><div class="caption">Figure 2.4.1.3: Lines of the program colored by type</div></div><p>And further, for a line like x = 5 + x to be a valid
	assignment, the first thing must be a valid variable name.
	"x" indeed satisfies all the rules, so this is OK.  Then there
	must be an "=", which there is.  Finally, there must appear a
	valid expression.  "5+x" is a combination of a variable and a
	number using the "+" operator, so indeed qualifies as a valid
	expression.  We can perform this analysis with the rest of the
	program, colorizing each syntax element according to its type,
	and we get: </p><div class="figure"><img src="/text/figures/2.4.1.fig4.png" width="500px"><div class="caption">Figure 2.4.1.4: Lines of the program, with sub-elements
	colorized by type.</div></div><p>We can also play this game with our example program from
	the previous section: </p><div class="code"><pre>x = 27
while(x != 1):
   y = x % 2
   if(y == 0):
      x = x / 2
   else:
      x = 3 * x + 1
   print(x)
print("Done!")</pre></div><p>and check line by line that it is a valid program. </p><div class="code"><pre>x = 27 </pre></div><p>This first line looks like it must be an assignment.  That means it has to look like </p><div class="code"><pre><i>variable name</i> = <i>expression</i></pre></div><p>Indeed, looking at the rules for variable names, "x" is a valid
variable name.  Further, expressions are defined as numbers, strings,
variables, or combinations thereof.  "27" is a number, and hence a valid
expression.  So indeed, this is a valid assignment line.</p><div class="code"><pre>while(x != 1):</pre></div><p>This is a while line, so it must look like</p><div class="code"><pre>while(<i>test</i>): </pre></div><p>So we need to check that <div class="code"><pre>x != 1</pre></div> is a valid test.  A test
has to look like:</p><div class="code"><pre><i>expression</i> <i>comparison</i> <i>expression</i></pre></div><p>and since x is a valid expression (it is a variable name), != is a
valid comparison (as we can see from our list of comparisons), and 1
is a valid expression (it is a number), and since this line is
followed by some indented lines, it is a valid while flow-control
line.</p><div class="code"><pre>   y = x % 2</pre></div><p>This line is indented as it is part of the while loop.  It looks
like an assignment, and indeed, y is a variable name, and x % 2, being
a combination of a variable name (x) and a number (2) using one of the
allowed operators (%), is an expression.  </p><div class="code"><pre>   if(y == 0):</pre></div><p>Much like we checked the while line, this is a valid "if" flow-control line.  In fact, since it has an "else" later, these form a valid if/else flow-control structure: </p><div class="code"><pre>
   if(y == 0):
      x = x / 2
   else:
      x = 3 * x + 1
</pre></div><p>Note that the line following the "if" line is indented by two
steps.  The if line is indented once because it is inside the while
loop.  Then remember that lines under the if statement have to be
indented three spaces more than the if line they are following.  The
effect is that the line</p><div class="code"><pre>      x = x / 2</pre></div><p>gets indented using six spaces since it is inside the "if", and the
"if" is already indented by three spaces since it is inside the
"while".
</p><div class="code"><pre>   print(x)</pre></div><p>This is a print line, which looks in general like </p><div class="code"><pre>print(<i>expression</i>)</pre></div><p>and is indeed valid, since x, being a variable name, is a valid expression.</p><div class="code"><pre>print("Done!")</pre></div><p>This is another valid print line, since "Done!" is a valid string, and strings are valid expressions.  </p><p>So we've checked that this program is syntactically valid.  One
final thing to point out about this syntax-checking procedure was its
mechanical, recursive nature: Once we identify that, say, the line</p><div class="code"><pre>x = 3 * x + 1</pre></div><p>is an assignment, that means it has to be constructed from a variable
name and an expression.  So we identify the pieces of the line that
should correspond to each of these: x is the variable name, and 3 * x
+ 1 should be the expression.  Then we check the definitions of each
of these: A variable name is any combination of letters, numbers, and
underscores, with certain exceptions.  x is thus a valid variable
name.  Now we check 3 * x + 1 is a valid expression similarly just by
going back to the definition of "expression" in the syntax.</p><div class="aside"><b>Aside: </b><p>The fact that our specification of the syntax leads
naturally to a mechanical checking procedure is important.  Since
ultimately, there has to be a program that understands the programming
language in order to turn it into ISA operations, it is natural that
this program be able to take such a specification and follow an
algorithm that generalizes our checking procedure.  In your future
computer science studies, you may take a course in designing your own
programming language, where you will make all this precise and

	  Assignments</div><div class="summary"><b>Summary: </b>Assignments are <i>variable_name</i>=<i>expression</i>.
      The assignment line will evaluate the expression and store the
      result in the variable named on the left side of the "=".
      </div><p>Recall that assignments are written 

<div class="code"><pre><i>variable name</i> = <i>expression</i></pre></div>

These are how we store and modify the values in variables.  For
instance, the line</p><div class="code"><pre>x = 2</pre></div><p>stores the value 2 in a variable called x.  It is worth noting that
here "=" is functioning as an action: "set x to have value 2", unlike
its use in mathematics, where it serves to make statements of fact ("x
is equal to 2").</p><p>If later in the program we want to use this stored value, we can refer to it by its name, x.  For instance, </p><div class="code"><pre>y = 2 * x</pre></div><p>will store the value 4 into another slot called y.  We've seen a couple of slightly trickier variants of this already.  For example, we can update variables using themselves: </p><div class="code"><pre>x = 2
x = 7 * x
x = 3 * x + x</pre></div><p>In the first line, x is set to 2.  Then in the second line, x is
set to 7*x.  To figure out what this stores in x, Python looks up what
was already stored in x.  It finds 2 was stored there, so it
multiplies this by 7 as requested, and stores the new value of 14 into
x.  The last line then sets x to 56 (convince yourself, if you are
unsure of why.)  </p><p>Assignment statements allow us to store the results of a
computation.  So suppose we wish to multiply x by 2 using the
multiplication operator *.  We might naively write the code:

<div class="code"><pre>2 * x</pre></div>

This is a valid expression, but we note from our syntax tree that an
expression is not one of the three valid kinds of lines of code!  We
do have valid lines like print lines which can print the value of an
expression, or assignment lines, which can store the value of an
expression.  So if you want to multiply x by 2, you have to store the
result somewhere, and so you would use an assignment line.  Either you
would create a new variable, maybe called y, and store the value
there:

<div class="code"><pre>y = 2 * x</pre></div>

or you might overwrite the old value of x with this new value: 

<div class="code"><pre>x = 2 * x</pre></div>

or you might print this quantity without storing it anywhere: 

<div class="code"><pre>print(2 * x)</pre></div></p></div></div><div class="section"><div id="sec_2_4_2_1"></div><div class="text"><div class="header">2.4.2.1:

variable names are, but there are a few further points to make. </p><p>Remember we said variable names cannot be words that Python treats
as special?  While you're not terribly likely to use them by accident,
it is good to have a complete list handy of what these all are.  So
here you go: </p><div class="code"><pre>

global</pre></div><p>The reason for this is relatively straightforward: If you named a
variable "if", then when the Python compiler gets to a line like</p><div class="code"><pre>if = 2</pre></div><p>The first thing it sees is "if".  So it might decide that this is in
fact a flow-control line of the "if" sort.  But then none of the rest
of the line makes sense.  In this example it could recover and
unambiguously realize that this must be an assignment, but other
examples using more complicated language features will not permit
disambiguation, and so these names are simply forbidden.
</p><p>Another possible gotcha is that variable names are case-sensitive: </p><div class="code"><pre>banana = 2
Banana = 3</pre></div><p>will create two completely different variables that can be used
independently.  Likewise, </p><div class="code"><pre>x = 3
y = 3*X</pre></div><p>will cause an error, since the second assignment tries to use the
variable called X.  We just created a variable called x, but that is
unrelated to the completely different variable called X.  </p><p>Finally, even though x, y, and z are valid variable names, and
using one-letter names will save on typing, there is a balance between
brevity and perspicuity to be struck: Imagine you're reading someone
else's code and you come upon a line like</p><div class="code"><pre>a = mass * radius * radius * roll_rate * roll_rate / 5 + mass * velocity * velocity / 2</pre></div><p>You'd say--"Great, you're doing some physics.  You've got some
object with mass, radius, velocity, rolling, and you've stored these
quantities in sensibly named variables called mass, radius, roll_date,
and velocity, and you're doing some massive computation involving all
of these, and you're storing it in some variable called a.  That's all
nice, but what the heck is this thing you're computing supposed to
mean?"  How much more obvious is this:</p><div class="code"><pre><font size="2pt">rolling_sphere_kinetic_energy = mass * radius * radius * roll_rate * roll_rate / 5 + mass * velocity * velocity / 2</font></pre></div><p>Obviously that could end up being a lot of typing to use this
variable repeatedly in the future, but it's worth thinking about.
Even KE would be a better name here than just a. </p><p>Beyond just making the names meaningful, there are differing
conventions found in the wild regarding naming.  In this book, if a
variable name is supposed to be a sequence of words (like above, when
we wanted to name a variable as 'rolling sphere kinetic energy'), we
will have all the words be lower-case and separated by underscores
(since spaces are not allowed in variable names).  

<div id="def_camel casing" class="definition"></div>There is another convention that some people
use, which is to have nothing separate the words but to capitalize the
first letter of each word, as in
<span class="icode">RollingSphereKineticEnergy</span>.  This is called <b>camel

	  Expressions</div><div class="summary"><b>Summary: </b> Expressions are the usual things, but they have to
	make sense: No adding a string to a number or dividing a

expression, i.e. any variable name, number, string, or valid
combination thereof using arithmetic operations.
</p><p><div id="def_value (expression)" class="definition"></div>Any expression has a <b>value</b>
which is the result of retrieving what is stored in each variable
mentioned in the expression and applying all the specified arithmetic
operations.  For example, the line <span class="icode">x = 2 * 3</span>
stores 6 into x because the value of the expression <span class="icode">2 *
3</span> is 6.  <div id="def_evaluation (expression)" class="definition"></div>The process of
determining the value of an expression is called
<b>evaluation</b>, and happens as follows:

<ul>
  <li>First, find any variable names in the expression and substitute
  in place of those variable names the values currently stored in the
  corresponding variables.  If any of the variables has no stored
  value, throw up a logic error.</li>
  <li>Then perform the operations specified in the expression, with
  the usual order of operations:
  <ul>
    <li>Anything in parentheses gets evaluated first.</li>
    <li>Any multiplication or division or modulus operations get
    performed left-to-right.  </li>
    <li>Then finally any addition and subtraction happen last.</li>
  </ul>
  If any operation has invalid inputs (e.g., division by zero or
  attempting to multiply things that are not numbers) throw up a logic
  error.
  </li>
</ul>

We can use this to determine what gets stored in x in the following case:

<div class="code"><pre>x = 4
y = x + 1
x = 2
x = 5*x + 2*(3 - y)</pre></div>

The first assignment sets <span class="icode">x</span> to 4.  The second one sets
y to whatever is the value of <span class="icode">x + 1</span>.  To evaluate this
expression, we plug in the current value of <span class="icode">x</span> (namely
4) in place of the name <span class="icode">x</span> in this expression, yielding
4 + 1, and then we perform the arithmetic to get a value of 5.  So the
second assignment assigns the value 5 to <span class="icode">y</span>.  The third
assignment stores the value 2 in <span class="icode">x</span>.</p><p>Finally, to find out what the last assignment stores in x, we need
to evaluate the last expression

<div class="code"><pre>5*x + 2*(3 - y)</pre></div>

To do this, we again plug in the current values of x and y in place of
their names: x is currently 2, and y is currently 5, so we get: 

<div class="code"><pre>5*2 + 2*(3 - 5)</pre></div>

Then we're back to a normal grade-school problem, whose answer is 10 -
4 = 6.  </p><p>In addition to numbers, expressions are also allowed to use strings.
For instance: 

<div class="code"><pre>"Hello world!"</pre></div>

is a valid expression, and hence 

<div class="code"><pre>s = "Hello world!"</pre></div>

is a valid assignment.  The only caveat is that arithmetic operations
and strings rarely make sense.  For example, adding a number to a
string isn't OK, so 

<div class="code"><pre>"Hello" + 2</pre></div>

is not a valid expression and will create a runtime error.  Likewise, 

<div class="code"><pre>"hello" * "aerodrome"</pre></div>

is not a valid expression and will similarly elicit an error.  </p><p>We can, however, add two strings: 

<div class="code"><pre>"hello" + "world"</pre></div>

is a valid expression, and its value is the <div id="def_concatenation" class="definition"></div><b>concatenation</b> (i.e., sticking the two
strings together to make one long string) of the two strings:
"helloworld"</p><p>So consider the following examples: </p><div class="code"><pre>x = Hello world!
y = z+1
z = 3+"hello"</pre></div><p>The variable names on the left sides are fine, but all three
expressions are invalid.  The first one looks like it is meant to be a
string, but because it is not enclosed in quotation marks, Python
doesn't realize this and instead tries to interpret it as variable
names.  But variable names cannot contain spaces or !s, so this falls
flat too, and Python gives up an error.  </p><p>The second looks valid--it is a combination of a variable name and a number using the operator +.  But we never defined a value for z!  So Python will try to store the value of this expression in y.  To do this, it will look up what we stored in z and try to add 1 to it.  And this will fail, because we never stored anything at all in z.  </p><p>The third example contravenes the weasel-word in the syntax
definition: We required only "valid" combinations of
variables, numbers, and strings.  Obviously adding two numbers is a
"valid" combination, but exactly what else counts?
Certainly almost any arithmetic operation should work on any numbers
or variables that store numbers.  For instance, </p><div class="code"><pre>x = 1+1
y = 78/x</pre></div><p>As mentioned, division (namely, / and %) when the right operand is
0 will cause an error, since as in mathematics generally, dividing by
zero does not make sense to a computer: </p><div class="code"><pre>x = 4
y = x/2-2
z = x % y</pre></div><p>Further, if you try to operate on a number and a string, this is not going to go well: </p><div class="code"><pre>x = "hello"
y = 89/x</pre></div></div></div><div class="section"><div id="sec_2_4_2_3"></div><div class="text"><div class="header">2.4.2.3:

	into a string, just escape a single backslash with a second
	one.<br><br><b>Definitions: </b><a href="#def_escape">escape</a>, <a href="#def_newline">newline</a></div><p>Recall we defined a string as any sequence of characters contained
inside quotation-marks.  It is a type of expression whose value is the
text inside the quotes.  But what if we change that text to itself
contain a quote?  For instance, </p><div class="code"><pre>print("hi")</pre></div><p>prints: </p><div class="code"><pre>hi</pre></div><p>But what if we want to print the following: </p><div class="code"><pre>"hi", he said</pre></div><p>We might try </p><div class="code"><pre>print(""hi", he said")</pre></div><p>But Python understands this as three things: </p><p>The string "", which contains no text, followed by the

of the string), followed by the string ", he said".
Disaster follows. </p><p>To include a quote, then, you need to <div id="def_escape" class="definition"></div><b>escape</b> it--that is, you precede it in the string
with a backslash.  In general, backslash is the string escape
character, meaning that whatever character comes after it doesn't have
its usual meaning, but has some special meaning.  The usual meaning of
the double-quote character is "this is the boundary of a string", but
if we precede it with a backslash, then its meaning just becomes just
"the double-quote character".  So </p><div class="code"><pre>print("\"hi\", he said")</pre></div><p>accomplishes the desired result.  Similarly, if we want to store a
string that contains multiple lines, like the string</p><div class="code"><pre>XXO
_O_
OX_</pre></div><p>which might represent a tic-tac-toe board in a game we're programming.  </p><p><div id="def_newline" class="definition"></div>It turns out that if we escape the character n,

debugging: If we have a program that is misbehaving and we want to get
some idea of what is happening, we can insert a print statement in the
middle.  For instance, suppose we accidentally wrote our 3x+1 program
thus:
</p><div class="code"><pre>x = 27
while(x != 1):
   y = x / 2
   if(y == 0):
      x = x / 2
   else:

So let us confirm that this is happening by printing y during the loop as well: </p><div class="code"><pre>x = 27
while(x != 1):
   y = x / 2
   if(y == 0):
      x = x / 2

...</pre></div><p>So something has gone wonky, since we shouldn't be seeing any decimals in the procedure run normally.  To make it even more clear, we'll add in some more print statements to show us which numbers being printed were x and which were y: </p><div class="code"><pre>x = 27
while(x != 1):
   y = x / 2

simple search engine for now).  To display the answer, we'll have to
have both the line

<div class="code"><pre>print("poems.txt") </pre></div>

and the line

<div class="code"><pre>print("raps.txt")</pre></div>

somewhere in our code.  But we definitely don't want both of them
to run--we only ever want at most one to run, but which one we want
depends on which file the word was found in.  Choosing what code to
run depending on some condition is exactly the job of the if

discuss that later.)</p><p>For if statements in general, the semantic meaning of the
indentation makes it very important, and often a source of subtle
bugs:

because the line 

<div class="code"><pre>print("potato")</pre></div>

is indented, which puts it in the block of lines that only get

	line.<br><br><b>Definitions: </b><a href="#def_infinite%20loop">infinite loop</a></div><p>Finally, we get to the last flow-control statement that we'll talk about here, namely while.  While is how you get a block of lines repeated several times: </p><div class="code"><pre>while(test): 
   lines that you want to run for as long as the test holds true
   (the test is re-run every time we get to the end of the indented lines)</pre></div><p>This comes in handy when, as an example, we want to print 20 smiley faces followed by a smirk.  We could use 21 print statements: </p><div class="code"><pre>print(":)")
print(":)")
print(":)")
print(":)")
print(":)")
print(":)")
print(":)")
print(":)")
print(":)")
print(":)")
print(":)")
print(":)")
print(":)")
print(":)")
print(":)")
print(":)")
print(":)")
print(":)")
print(":)")
print(":)")
print(":/")</pre></div><p>But if we wanted to print 100 smileys, our program would get rather
long, and it may be harder to ensure we got exactly 100 print
statements in there.  To simplify this dramatically, we can instead
use a while statement.  This requires some thought, however: The while
statement will repeat the indented block as long as the test is true.
So clearly we want the print line to be in the indented block: </p><div class="code"><pre>while(<i>something</i>):
   print(":)")
print(":/")</pre></div><p>What should the something be?  We want the indented block to repeat
20 times, so the something should be a test that is true the first 20
times it is run, but not the 21st time.  One way to accomplish this is
to have a counter variable that counts how many times the indented
block has been run.  When the program starts, we'll set the counter to
0: </p><div class="code"><pre>counter = 0
while(<i>something</i>): 
   print(":)")
print(":/")</pre></div><p>Except now, each time the block is run, we want the counter to increase by 1.  An assignment that can increase the counter by 1 is: </p><div class="code"><pre>counter = counter + 1</pre></div><p>so if we put this inside the indented block, it will be run each time the indented block is run: </p><div class="code"><pre>counter = 0
while(<i>something</i>): 
   print(":)")
   counter = counter + 1
print(":/")</pre></div><p>Now finally, what should the something be?  The first time the while block is run, counter will start as 0 and get updated to 1.  The second time, it will start as 1 and be updated to 2.  The third time, the counter will start as 2 and be updated to 3 during the execution of the block.  So if the something is </p><div class="code"><pre>counter &lt; 3</pre></div><p>then after the third run of the block, counter will be 3, so the test will fail, and the block will not be repeated a fourth time, and the line will proceed to the line </p><div class="code"><pre>print(":/")</pre></div><p>Thus if we wanted to print three smileys and then a smirk, we would do: </p><div class="code"><pre>counter = 0
while(counter &lt; 3): 
   print(":)")
   counter = counter + 1
print(":/")</pre></div><p>We can double-check our understanding of what happens by single-stepping this program: </p><table>

</table><p>Thus to accomplish the original goal, we can use the program: </p><div class="code"><pre>counter = 0
while(counter &lt; 20): 
	print(":)")
	counter = counter + 1
print(":/")</pre></div><p>This pattern of having a counter incrementing by 1 in a while loop is very common, and you should bear it closely in mind for the future, but it is not the only paradigm for while loops.  For example, we can use a while loop to print all the powers of 2 less than a thousand: </p><div class="code"><pre>x = 1
while(x &lt; 1000):
   print(x)
   x = 2*x
print("Done")</pre></div><p>If you're not comfortable with why this program accomplishes this goal, single-step it in the same manner as before to see.</p><p>Finally, in the spirit of the last dumb if/else example, we also
have a dumb while loop example.  Remember, 1 == 1 is still a valid
test, so </p><div class="code"><pre>while(1 == 1):
   print(":)")</pre></div><p>is a valid while loop.  <div id="def_infinite loop" class="definition"></div>Since the test is
always true, and the while statement is supposed to repeat the
indented lines for as long as the condition is true, it will print
smileys forever.  This is called an <b>infinite loop</b>.  They
can happen intentionally when you're just trying to be infinitely
happy like in the above example, but they are generally a run-time
error (i.e., part of a valid program that provides undesirable
behavior when run), and are not always as obvious as that first
example might lead you to believe.  For instance: </p><div class="code"><pre>x = 49
while(x*x % 4 != 3):
   x = x + 1

	  Factorial</div><div class="summary"><b>Summary: </b><p>To write a program that computes factorials (10
	factorial is 10*9*8*7*6*5*4*3*2*1, for example) we use the idea of a
	while loop with a counter, but we keep another variable that
	will eventually store the answer that we multiply by the
	counter each time we go through the loop.</p>

	<p>There is some subtlety in getting exactly the right answer
	and not going through the loop one too many or one to few
	times.</p><br><br><b>Definitions: </b><a href="#def_off-by-one%20error">off-by-one error</a></div><p><b>Introduction: </b></p><p>The factorial is a mathematical operator that takes in a
	  single positive integer (1, 2, 3, ...) and outputs the
	  product of all the positive integers at or below the input.
	  The factorial of 5 is written as "5!".  So 5! =
	  5*4*3*2*1 = 120, and 10! = 10*9*8*7*6*5*4*3*2*1 = 3628800.
	  In this example, we wish to write a program that will
	  compute the actual value of 10!.</p><p><b>Algorithm: </b></p><p>The definition above is completely unambiguous, and
	  explains perfectly well to a human how to compute
	  factorials.  On the other hand, we saw earlier a complete
	  list of all the things we can tell a computer how to do,
	  namely assignment, print, if, if/else, and while.  You'll
	  note that "multiply the integers 1 through 10" is not on
	  that list, so we need to find a way of telling the computer
	  how to compute 10! using only these simpler operations.</p><p>From one perspective, this is easy: Clearly we want to
	  print the product 1*2*3*...*10.  If we reference our chart
	  above, we see that we are allowed to print any expression.
	  But what was an expression?  It was any number, string,
	  variable, or combination thereof using operations +, -, *,
	  /, %.  Aha!  So, for example, 1*2*3*4*5 is an expression (as
	  it is a combination of numbers using the operation *).
	  Therefore:
	  </p><p><b>Program: </b></p><div class="code"><pre>print(1*2*3*4*5*6*7*8*9*10)</pre></div><p><b>Debrief: </b></p><p>That was all very good, except now say I want to know
	  what is 27!  Now I have to make non-trivial and tedious
	  changes to the program--it is basically the same work as
	  doing this on a calculator by hand!  In short, we have a
	  problem of scalability.  This program cannot compute larger
	  factorials without us doing a large amount of work also to
	  change it.  What we would like is a program that looks
	  like:</p><div class="code"><pre>input = 10
... some things
... some more things
print(answer)</pre></div><p>That is, the program starts by storing the desired input value in a
variable, and then whatever that value is, it does some computation
and eventually ends up with the factorial of this initial value stored
in the variable called answer.</p><p>This way, if we decide later that we instead wanted 27!, we can just change the first line to 

<div class="code"><pre>input = 27</pre></div>

and leave the rest of the program untouched, and still get the correct answer.  </p><p><b>Algorithm, Mark II: </b></p><p>The above desired form of the program tells us the first and last steps of the algorithm: 

<div class="code"><pre>Step 1: Store the number whose factorial we want in a variable called input.  
...
Step last: print the number stored in the variable answer.  
</pre></div>

So clearly at some point we'll need to make a variable called answer.
May as well make that step 2.  So step 2 will be an assignment (a
valid operation), setting answer equal to...what?  Clearly we cannot
just say <span class="icode">answer = input!</span> since ! is not one of the
operations that Python understands.  So let's just start
small--<span class="icode">answer = 1</span>.

<div class="code"><pre>Step 1: Store the number whose factorial we want in a variable called input.  
Step 2: Store the number 1 in the variable answer.
...
Step last: print the number stored in the variable answer.  
</pre></div>

Now, clearly what we need to do is to first multiply answer by 2,
and then by 3, and then by 4, and so on until we get to 10.  So let us
store the thing we're multiplying by in yet another variable.  This
variable will be counting up from 2, and will be multiplied into
answer at each step.  So we'll call this variable counter, and since
the first multiplication will be by 2, we'll start this variable at 2.


<div class="code"><pre>Step 1: Store the number whose factorial we want in a variable called input.  
Step 2: Store the number 1 in the variable answer.
Step 3: Store the number 2 in the variable counter.
...
Step last: print the number stored in the variable answer.  </pre></div>


Now we want to increment counter repeatedly until it is 10, or, more precisely, until it matches whatever is in the variable input.  Intuitively this process looks like: 

<div class="code"><pre>answer = answer*counter
counter = counter + 1
answer = answer * counter
counter = counter + 1
answer = answer * counter
counter = counter + 1
answer = answer * counter
counter = counter + 1
...</pre></div>

except we want this to stop when counter exceeds input.  </p><p>So: 

<div class="code"><pre>Step 1: Store the number whose factorial we want in a variable called input.  
Step 2: Store the number 1 in the variable answer.
Step 3: Store the number 2 in the variable counter.
Step 4: Repeat the following until counter is greater than input: 
	Substep 1: Replace answer with answer * counter
	Substep 2: Increment counter by 1
Step 5: print the number stored in the variable answer.  </pre></div>

And recall that this 'repeat the following' sort of step is something
that we can tell the computer to do--this is what the while
instruction does!  So we do: </p><p><b>Program, Mark II: </b></p><div class="code"><pre>input = 10
answer = 1
counter = 2
while(counter &lt; input): 
   answer = answer * counter
   counter = counter + 1
print(answer)</pre></div><p>Let us single-step this program with a slightly smaller input: 4.  So the program should compute 4! = 4*3*2*1 = 24 and print this result.  Let us see: </p><table><tr>

counter was set to 4 at the end of the loop body, and then because
counter &lt; input was false (4 is not less than 4), the next iteration
of the loop, which would have done the multiplication by 4, did not
run.</p><p><div id="def_off-by-one error" class="definition"></div>This is a particularly notorious kind of runtime error called an
<b>off-by-one error</b>.  There are a couple of possible fixes.  The simplest
is that we want the loop to run when counter is less than input or
equal to it.  To get this behavior, we replace &lt; by &lt;= to get:

<div class="code"><pre>input = 10
answer = 1
counter = 2
while(counter &lt;= input): 
answer = answer * counter
counter = counter + 1
print(answer)
</pre></div>

Another possible fix, the analysis of which is left as an exercise, is the following: 

<div class="code"><pre>input = 10
answer = 1
counter = 1
while(counter &lt; input): 
   counter = counter + 1
   answer = answer * counter
print(answer)</pre></div>
</p><p><b>Debrief: </b></p><p>So finally we have a factorial program that we can easily use to compute larger factorials too: 

<div class="code"><pre>input = 50
answer = 1
counter = 2
while(counter &lt;= input): 
   answer = answer * counter
   counter = counter + 1
print(answer)</pre></div>

Later we will learn how to make the program ask for and receive input from the person running the program (as opposed to now, when you have to actually change the program to affect the computation it runs).  Having written the program not using any foreknowledge of the value of the input, it will be easy plug in the code for reading like: 

<div class="code"><pre>[get user's input and store its value in the variable input]
answer = 1
counter = 2
while(counter &lt;= input): 
   answer = answer * counter
   counter = counter + 1
print(answer)</pre></div>

	  Primality testing</div><div class="summary"><b>Summary: </b>To test if a number is prime, we simply need to take
	all the numbers between that 1 and number (exclusive), and
	check if any of those numbers divides into our number evenly.
	To do this checking, we can use a while loop with a counter,
	and to check whether a number divides evenly into another, we
	can use the modulus operator.  This algorithm is badly
	inefficient, and finding a more efficient one is a hard
	problem.  </div><p><b>Introduction: </b></p><p>A prime number is a positive integer that is not evenly
	  divisible by any positive integer other than itself and 1.
	  For instance, 12 is evenly divisible by 4 and therefore is
	  not prime.  13, on the other hand is prime.  Prime numbers
	  are of interest because every number can be built out of
	  primes.  For example, we just saw that 12 is evenly
	  divisible by 4.  More specifically, 12 = 4*3.  4, in turn,
	  is also not prime--it is evenly divisible by 2.  More
	  specifically, 4 = 2*2.  So when we wrote 12 = 4*3, we could
	  break it up further as 12 = 2*2*3.  2 and 3 are primes, so
	  we have shown how to make 12 using just prime numbers.</p><p>It is sometimes of great interest to determine whether a
	  number is prime.  In this section, we shall write a program
	  capable of doing so.  Specifically, the program shall start
	  with a line like 

	  <div class="code"><pre>n = 101231</pre></div>

	  and shall, at the end, print either "n is prime" or "n is
	  not prime" depending on the result of its test. </p><p><b>Algorithm: </b></p><p>We are given a number, say stored in a variable called n.
	  We want to test if n is prime.  As before, we start with the
	  definition: If it is prime, then no number between 2 and n-1
	  inclusive divides into n evenly.  Thus we can step through
	  these numbers in sequence, as we did with the counter
	  variable in the previous example, and test each one in turn
	  to see if it divides into n evenly.</p><div class="code"><pre>Step 1: n = 10000001
Step 2: counter = 2
Step 3: Repeat the following as long as counter &lt; n: 
	Substep 1: Test if counter divides into n evenly
	Substep 2: Increment counter</pre></div><p>This seems to cover all the things required by the
	definition of "prime", but it is still quite incomplete: What
	do we do if counter does divide evenly into n?  And for that
	matter, what do we do at the end of the loop?</p><p>In the course of step 3, we'll discover whether or not n was
	prime.  If we store this information somehow, then at the end
	of the loop we can print out the result based on this stored
	information.  To this end, we'll also create a variable called
	is_prime.  We'll start with it set to 1, and if we find a
	divisor, we'll set it to 0.  Then, at the end, we'll test the
	value of is_prime and print as appropriate.  </p><div class="code"><pre>Step 1: n = 10000001
Step 2: counter = 2
Step 3: is_prime = 1
Step 4: Repeat the following as long as counter &lt; n: 
	Substep 1: Test if counter divides into n evenly.  If it does, set is_prime to 0
	Substep 2: Increment counter
Step 5: If is_prime is 1, print "n is prime"
Step 6: If is_prime is 0, print "n is not prime"</pre></div><p><b>Program:</b></p><p>To turn this into an honest program is reasonably
	straightforward.  The elements we have not yet used are the
	tests, which are accomplished with the if/else instructions.
	How to see if <span class="icode">counter</span> divides <span class="icode">n</span>
	evenly?  One way to do it is to divide n by counter and see if
	the quotient is an integer.  However we don't yet have any
	operation for testing "is this variable an integer",
	so that's no good for now.  Another way would be to divide n
	by counter and see if the remainder is 0.  Recall we can get
	the remainder of this division with n % counter.  So we
	get:</p><div class="code"><pre>n = 1000001
counter = 2
is_prime = 1
while(counter &lt; n):
   if(n % counter == 0): 
      is_prime = 0
   counter = counter + 1
if(is_prime == 1):
   print("n is prime")
if(is_prime == 0):
   print("n is not prime")</pre></div><p>This may take quite a few steps.  Remember that you can
        adjust how many steps are taken by the "step" button using the
        input box next to that button.  </p><p><b>Debrief: </b></p><p>It is worth noting that the values we chose for the
	variable is_prime--0 to represent that the number is not
	prime, and 1 to represent that it is--were completely
	arbitrary.  We could have started instead by setting is_prime
	to the string "durian", and then in the loop if we found a
	divisor of n, we could change it to the string "penguin goes
	shopping" and get the exact same behavior: </p><div class="code"><pre>n = 1000001
counter = 2
is_prime = "durian"
while(counter &lt; n):
   if(n % counter == 0): 
      is_prime = "penguin goes shopping"
   counter = counter + 1
if(is_prime == "durian"):
   print("n is prime")
if(is_prime == "penguin goes shopping"):
   print("n is not prime")</pre></div><p>The use of 1 and 0 is sort of standard, however, because in
        some sense (which we will discuss later), it takes the least
        amount of space possible to store a variable that is only ever
        1 or 0, whereas if we have to store the strings "durian" and
        "penguin does shopping", this requires more space.  In many
        contexts, therefore, when we have a variable whose value
        represents the truth of some statement, a value of 1
        conventionally represents "true" and a value of 0 represents
        "false".</p><p>On the topic of potential improvements, one thing that
	might be nice is for this program to not just tell us that a

	already--for instance, we don't have to test all the possible

	with testing only to n/2, since if n/2 evenly divides n, then
	2 also evenly divides n, so we would have caught that already.
	Also, none of the numbers between n/2 and n can possibly
	divide evenly into n.  In fact we can get away with fewer than
	that.  </p><p>For a further inefficiency, you should see how long it
	takes to run in tell us that 222 isn't prime, and compare this
	with how many steps you think ought to be needed.  </p><p>The general question of whether this problem had a truly
	efficient solution remained frustratingly unanswered for years

	  Counting digits</div><div class="summary"><b>Summary: </b>To count the digits in a number, we repeatedly divide
	it by 10 until it is smaller than 1.  If we keep a counter as
	we do this, then the number of times we divide by 10 will be
	the number of digits in the number (provided we do this
	carefully and avoid off-by-one errors).  </div><p><b>Introduction: </b></p><p>Starting with some number,
	  count how many digits are required to write the number
	  down.  For example, with the number 1045, the answer would
	  be 4.</p><p><b>Algorithm: </b></p><p>This is one of those problems that is very easy to do by
	  hand: When you have a number, it is given to you as a list
	  of digits, so you just count the digits on the paper--no
	  sweat.  But to a computer, 'look at how many digits are in
	  this number' isn't one of the operations we are allowed to
	  do to numbers.  All we can do is add, subtract, multiply,
	  and divide, and so to solve the problem with a computer, we
	  need to think of how to solve it with only these operations
	  available to us.  </p><p>So, to get the number of digits in a number
	  mathematically, we can repeatedly divide it by 10 until it
	  gets below 1.  The number of times we have to do this is the
	  number of digits in the number.  For instance, 9 / 10 = 0.9,
	  so we only have to divide once, so the number 9 has one
	  digit.  128 / 10 = 12.8, 12.8 / 10 = 1.28, 1.28 / 10 =
	  0.128.  So it takes three divisions to get to below 1, and
	  indeed, 128 has three digits.</p><p>To accomplish this programmatically, we will need two
	  variables--one to store the number that we will repeatedly
	  divide--say this is called <span class="icode">n</span>, and another to
	  store how many times we've divided so far--say this one is
	  called <span class="icode">digit_count</span>.  Then we can write the
	  algorithm more precisely as: </p><div class="code"><pre>Step 1: n = 1238129 (or whatever)
Step 2: digit_count = 0
Step 3: Repeat the following as long as n &gt; 1:
	Substep 1: Increment digit_count
	Substep 2: Divide n by 10
Step 4: Print digit_count</pre></div><p><b>Program: </b></p><div class="code"><pre>n = 1238129
digit_count = 0
while(n &gt; 1):
   digit_count = digit_count + 1
   n = n/10
print(digit_count)</pre></div><p>You would be right to worry about an off-by-one error--do we start
digit_count at 0 or at 1?  We can tell by single-stepping the program
in a simple case, as we did before, or you can run the program with a
few different inputs as examples.  Convince yourself that we are OK.
</p><p>There is also a tricky edge-case that may have slipped your notice,
however: Consider what happens when we start with <span class="icode">n = 1</span>:
First <span class="icode">digit_count</span> will be set to 0, and then we'll run the
while loop as long as <span class="icode">n &gt; 1</span>.  But even at the start, this
test fails, as <span class="icode">n = 1</span>, so <span class="icode">n</span> is not greater than
1!  So the stuff inside the while loop gets skipped entirely, and the
value of <span class="icode">digit_count</span>--namely 0--gets printed.  And this is
definitely the wrong answer--the number 1 has one digit!  </p><p>In fact, this isn't the only issue--this problem shows up whenever
<span class="icode">n</span> gets set to 1 during execution, for example if it started
at 1000, we would get the wrong answer of 3.  </p><p>To fix this, we simply need to realize that we wrote our algorithm
correctly--we stop if n is below 1--but our program doesn't reflect
this--it stops if n is below 1 <i>or if n is equal to 1</i>.  We can
rectify this by telling it to continue with the while loop even when n
is 1:

<div class="code"><pre>n = 1238129
digit_count = 0
while(n &gt;= 1):
   digit_count = digit_count + 1
   n = n/10
print(digit_count)</pre></div>

</p><p><b>Debrief: </b></p><p>We should note that this program doesn't work for non-integers, nor
for integers below 1.  </p><p>If you played around with the factorial program, you probably got
the sense that factorials were pretty huge.  To get an idea of how
huge, we can combine our digit-counting program with our factorial
program to find out how many digits are in 99!: </p><div class="code"><pre>input = 99
answer = 1
counter = 1
while(counter &lt; input): 
   counter = counter + 1
   answer = answer * counter
n = answer
digit_count = 0
while(n &gt;= 1):
   digit_count = digit_count + 1
   n = n/10
print(digit_count)</pre></div></div></div><div class="section"><div id="sec_2_6"></div><div class="text"><div class="header">2.6:

      write here will only be indicative of the ideas involved, since
      we don't yet know enough of the Python language to provide a

      </p></div></div><div class="section"><div id="sec_2_6_1"></div><div class="text"><div class="header">2.6.1: 
	  Search engine</div><p>As we discussed in chapter 1, a working search engine solves many different problems--storing lots of files on lots of computers, displaying a search box to millions of people per minute, and more.  Here, we shall suppose we have the files split into words and each word is stored in its own variable, like so:   </p><div class="code"><pre>file1_name = "Ode on the death of a favorite cat"
file1_word1 = "twas"
file1_word2 = "on"
file1_word3 = "a"
file1_word4 = "lofty"
file1_word5 = "vases"
file1_word6 = "side"
file2_name = "Elegy written in a country churchyard"
file2_word1 = "the"
file2_word2 = "curfew"
file2_word3 = "tolls"
file2_word4 = "the"
file2_word5 = "knell"
file2_word6 = "of"
file2_word7 = "parting"
file2_word8 = "day"</pre></div><p>We'll also suppose the word that the user searched for is already stored for us in a variable.  Then the game is just to take each word from each file and compare it to the search word.  </p><div class="code"><pre>search_word = "the"</pre></div><p>Then, to make do the actual searching is just a painful slog of if statements like: </p><div class="code"><pre>if(search_word == file1_word1): 
   print(file1_name)</pre></div><p>So the full program looks like: </p><div class="code"><pre>search_word = "the"
file1_name = "Ode on the death of a favorite cat"
file1_word1 = "twas"
file1_word2 = "on"
file1_word3 = "a"
file1_word4 = "lofty"
file1_word5 = "vases"
file1_word6 = "side"
file2_name = "Elegy written in a country churchyard"

	  Game console</div><p><b>Comparing scores:</b></p><p>We started this chapter with an example algorithm for comparing the scores of three players.  We'll now implement this algorithm as a Python program, supposing we have the three scores stored in three variables, say like so: </p><div class="code"><pre>player1_score = 20
player2_score = 21
player3_score = -1</pre></div><p>Recall the algorithm: </p><div class="code"><pre>If score1 is greater than score2 and score1 is also
greater than score3: Display the text: "PLAYER 1 WINS!"

If not, then if score2 is greater than score1 and score2 is also
greater than score3: Display the text: "PLAYER 2 WINS!"

If not, then if score3 is greater than score1 and score3 is also
greater than score2: Display the text: "PLAYER 3 WINS!"
</pre></div><p>So the main difficulty is in performing this combined test, where
we test two things at once.  We can perform one of the tests like:
</p><div class="code"><pre>if(player1_score &gt; player2_score):
   ...
</pre></div><p>But then we need to put the second test of step 1, namely, player1_score &gt; player3_score, somewhere.  The point is that we can break up the algorithm to perform only one test at a time: Instead of

<div class="code"><pre>If score1 is greater than score2 and score1 is also
greater than score3: Display the text: "PLAYER 1 WINS!"</pre></div>

We can say

<div class="code"><pre>If score1 is greater than score2, then test if score1 is greater
than score3.  If this second test is true, print the text: "PLAYER 1 WINS!"</pre></div>

Thus we get the code:

<div class="code"><pre>if(player1_score &gt; player2_score):
   if(player1_score &gt; player3_score):
      print("PLAYER 1 WINS")</pre></div>

So for a full version of this program, we get:

<div class="code"><pre>player1_score = 20
player2_score = 21
player3_score = -1
if(player1_score &gt; player2_score):
   if(player1_score &gt; player3_score):
      print("PLAYER 1 WINS")
if(player2_score &gt; player1_score):
   if(player2_score &gt; player3_score):
      print("PLAYER 2 WINS")
if(player3_score &gt; player1_score):
   if(player3_score &gt; player2_score):
      print("PLAYER 3 WINS")</pre></div>
</p><p><b>Computing distances: </b></p><p>As discussed at in chapter 1, one of the things that happens
frequently in a game is that we need to compute distances between
points.  Let us say we are dealing with 2D points, whose coordinates
are stored in variables like:

<div class="code"><pre>point1_x = 20
point1_y = 55
point2_x = 10
point2_y = 60</pre></div>

representing point 1 being (20,55) and point2 being (10,60).  </p><p>And say we want to see which point is furthest away from the origin--(0,0).  Then the algorithm is straightforward: </p><div class="code"><pre>Compute the distance of point 1 to the origin and store it in a variable
Compute the distance of point 2 to the origin and store it in another variable
If the first variable is larger than the second, print that point 1 is closer to the origin
If the second variable is larger than the first, print that point 2 is closer to the origin
If the two variables are equal, print that they are the same distance to the origin
</pre></div><p>The one problem that presents is that the distance to the origin is given by </p><div class="code"><pre>√(x1*x1 + y1*y1)</pre></div><p>but we don't yet have an operation for square root.  Fortunately,
instead of comparing √(x1*x1 + y1*y1) with √(x2*x2 + y2*y2), we
can just compare, x1*x1 + y1*y1 with x2*x2 + y2*y2, since sqrt is an
increasing function.  So we'll modify our algorithm to not compute the
distances, but rather the square distances, and get the program: </p><div class="code"><pre>point1_x = 20
point1_y = 55
point2_x = 10
point2_y = 60
square_distance1 = point1_x*point1_x + point1_y*point1_y
square_distance2 = point2_x*point2_x + point2_y*point2_y
if(square_distance1 &lt; square_distance2): 
   print("Point 1 is closer to origin")
if(square_distance1 &gt; square_distance2): 
   print("Point 2 is closer to origin")
if(square_distance1 == square_distance2): 
   print("Points are the same distance from the origin")</pre></div></div></div><div class="section"><div id="sec_2_6_3"></div><div class="text"><div class="header">2.6.3: 
	  Mobile phone</div><p>Recall our earlier discussion of a cell phone with an

	rather dramatically, by random noise.  Since the noise is
	equally likely to cause the sensor to overestimate as to
	underestimate, we can take some number of readings from the

used to execute a program. These resources can include time, memory,
CPU, money, etc.. Scalability is how well a program would operate if
it were required to handle big data (how efficiently it operates when
scaled up). For example, a program that can handle 3 players playing a

program more efficient if they know it will never be used on a large
scale. For example, a video game developer may create a game that runs
well for 5 people playing at once, but would work inefficiently with
20 people playing at once. The developer doesn’t need to improve
his/her program’s efficiency if it is not meant to be scaled beyond 5

Round ?? up to 3.1416 and use only the mathematical operations we have learned thus far (+, -, *, /, %). </p>
<p>Remember that your algorithm must abide by Order of Operations rules (otherwise known as PEMDAS).
</p>
<p><b>Part B</b>: Now turn your algorithm into a program in
Python. End your program by printing, "the volume of the sphere is
____". Where the "____" is the value of your volume variable.
</p>
<p>#Assume the value of the sphere’s diameter has already been put into a
#variable called "diameter" and use that variable for your calculations
</p>
<p><b>Part C</b>: Test your program in the python simulator. In order to do this, you
 must precede your program with a line that creates the "diameter" variable and 
sets it equal to some value of your choice. You can check that your volume
 algorithm is correct by searching "volume of a sphere with diameter
 [your diameter value]" at http://www.wolframalpha.com. <br>
