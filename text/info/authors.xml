    mathematics department at the University of Wisconsin--Madison,
    where he spends his time thinking and writing about numbers.  He
    is an occasional software developer, having written over 17 lines
    of code in his life (it might be more, but he doesn't usually
    think about numbers that large).  He is also, apparently, an
    author.</p>
