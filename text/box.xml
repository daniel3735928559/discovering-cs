    <title>Introduction</title>
    <description>
      <p>Chapter 1 introduces the course as a whole, starting with a
      precise definition of what we mean by the word "computer".  This
      will be a relatively simple notion, and the course will revolve
      around two separate questions:
      <ul><li>How can we program a computer?</li>
      <li>How can we build a computer?</li></ul>

      The first question will be addressed in chapters 2&#8211;6, and the
      second in chapters 7&#8211;8.</p>

    <title>Programming</title>
    <description>
      <p>Chapter 2 starts in on the study of programming.  Programming
      occurs in two steps: When we come up against a problem, the
      first step is to describe a precise sequence of steps that will
      solve it.  Such a set of steps, written in English (or human
      language of choice) is called an algorithm, and is the focus of
      section 2.2.  </p>

      <p>Once we have an algorithm, the second step is to rewrite that
      algorithm not in human language, but in a
      computer-understandable language.  This will be the program.  In
      section 2.3, we introduce a particular programming language--a
      simplified version of Python--to illustrate this process.  </p>
    </description>

    <title>Advanced Programming</title>
    <description>
      <p>In chapter 2, we learned a simple subset of the Python
      programming language.  Its simplicity made it easier to explain,
      but hard to use for any complicated or interesting tasks.
      Chapter 3 is devoted to expanding our knowledge of Python so we
      can work toward programs that actually behave like software as
      we know it in the real world.  </p>

    <title>Numbers in Computer Science</title>
    <description>
      <p>Chapter 4 is a brief digression: As we descend to the level
      of the computer hardware, we are going to need a new language to
      talk about numbers <i>as a computer understands them</i>.  This
      is accomplished by using binary representations for numbers, as
      is explained in chapter 4.</p>
    </description>
  </chapter>
  <chapter>
    <title>ISA</title>
    <description>
      <p>In chapters 2 and 3, we learned our first programming
      language.  This language is not understood or used directly by
      the computer.  Instead, the computer understands a much more
      basic language, called the ISA, and our programs from chapters 2
      and 3 had to be translated to this basic language before being
      run by the computer.  </p>

      <p>To truly understand what a computer does under the hood, we
      need to learn to work with the ISA directly, which is the goal
      of chapter 5.  This happens in two parts: We learn what the main
      components inside the computer are (that is, the computer's
      "architecture"), and then we learn what instructions the
      computer itself natively understands for manipulating these
      components (that is, the computer's "instruction set").</p>
    </description>
  </chapter>
  <chapter>
    <title>Encodings and the ISA</title>
    <description>
      <p>Chapter 5 is another brief but fun digression to address the
      question of, now that we know that the computer deals in
      numbers, how is it that we can manipulate things like text and
      images using computers as well?  The answer is that everything
      that a computer with, from text to images to the ISA
      instructions themselves, must actually be numbers behind the
      scenes.  The schemes by which numbers are made to correspond to
      text or to graphical data or to instructions are called
      encodings, and we explore several different types of encoding in
      this chapter.</p>

  <chapter>
    <title>Microarchitecture</title>
    <description>
      <p>Chapter 7 switches to the second question of "How to build a
      computer".  Since we now understand the ISA, we can do this by
      taking the major tasks that the various ISA instructions need to
      be able to accomplish, imagining we have some black-box circuit
      components that perform these tasks, and examining how the
      circuit components can be connected to create an actual machine
      that accomplishes the ISA tasks--that is, a computer!  </p>
    </description>
  </chapter>
  <chapter>
    <title>Digital Logic and Transistors</title>
    <description>
      <p>Once we have in hand a list of the circuit components we need
      to build a machine capable of executing ISA instructions, all
      that remains is to build these components.  To do this, we
      examine in chapter 8 the building blocks of digital circuits:
      Logic gates and, ultimately, transistors.  </p>
