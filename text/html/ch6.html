	  Assembly language, or "Turning Python code into ISA code"</div><div class="summary"><b>Summary: </b>Assembly language is the programming language that one often
uses to write code in the ISA.  It is easy to convert from assembly to
nothing but pure ISA instructions--a job that is done by an
'assembler'--but because of a few key features, it is also easier to
write assembly than the ISA itself.<br><br><b>Definitions: </b><a href="#def_assembly%20language">assembly language</a>, <a href="#def_assembler">assembler</a></div><p>Writing useful code using the ISA can be a pain.  Of course,
because of the limited work done by each individual instruction,
coding at this level is going to be difficult no matter what.  At the
same time, there are some things that people found succifiently
annoying that they created a very slight additional layer on top of
the ISA.  This layer is known as "assembly language".  </p><p><span id="def_assembly language" class="definition"></span><b>Assembly language </b> is a
programming language, and as such is defined in terms of its syntax
and semantics.  Assembly language's particular syntax mostly consists
of raw ISA instruction mnemonics exactly as we learned them in the
previous section, with just a few additional features to simplify some
of the more painful tasks when programming in the ISA directly.
 The specific tasks that assembly language simplifies are the
following:

<ul>
<li><b>Specifying offsets for relative jumps and branches: </b>Recall
our example rcall code: We have multiple rcalls all calling back to a
single place in the code.  But because rcall requires an offset, we
had to recompute the operand for each individual rcall.  Further, if
we ever want to add anything to the middle of the program, we would
have to recalculate all these offsets again!  Assembly language
includes a mechanism called labels for naming locations in the code,
and allows these to be provided as operands to rjmp and rcall instead
so that we can effectively think "jump to this point in the code"
rather than "jump 3 instructions backward".</li>
<li><b>Initializing RAM with specified data: </b>Currently, if we want a
large amount of data stored in RAM, then since the only way of storing
data we have is with the st instructions, we will have to do one st
instruction for each number we want stored.  This can get tedious if we
have hundreds of things to store, so assembly provides a mechanism to
pre-populate RAM at specified locations with whatever values are
desired.</li>
<li><b>Strings: </b>We haven't yet discussed how Python's strings can
be realized in the ISA.  This discussion will largely be deferred to
the next chapter, but for now we mention that there is some way to
correspond letters in a string to numbers 0-255.  So storing a string
would involve looking up which letters correspond to which numbers and
using st instructions to store the appropriate sequence of numbers.
Assembly includes syntax to let us simply type the desired string and
have the assembler convert this to numbers for storage. </li>
</ul>
</p><p><span id="def_assembler" class="definition"></span>Now, with assembly language, we're still
trying to program the computer--that is, recall, we're trying to get
the right numbers corresponding to our desired instructions into the
computer's RAM.  When we write a program in assembly language, another
program called an <b>assembler</b> (analogous to the Python compiler)
will convert our program into numbers for storage into the program
memory. Moreover, assembly language not only allows you to
populate program memory with numbers corresponding to instructions,
but also allows you to pre-populate RAM with numbers if desired.</p><p>As mentioned, assembly language is a programming language, so just
as we explained the Python programming language in terms of its
syntax--what constructions are legal, and its semantics--what the
constructions mean, we can do this with assembly.  Further, since all
an assembly language program is meant to do is turn into certain
numbers that will go into program memory and certain other numbers
that go into RAM, describing the semantics of an element of assembly
language is as easy as explaining what numbers it corresponds to and
where in memory those numbers are stored.  </p><table>

	  Labels</div><p>Labels can be inserted directly into the program as lines that
  look like:

    <div class="code"><pre><i>label_name</i>: </pre></div>
    
    Where a label name can be exactly what a variable name in Python
    could be: Anything containing only letters, numbers, or underscores,
    except it cannot start with a number.</p><p>Labels are used to mark a place in the program to refer to in
  actual instructions, as in the examples of the previous section.
  They do not themselves constitute actual instructions.  For example,
  the two programs below are identical in terms of the instructions
  that will be stored in program memory: 

  <sim-avr text="'ldi r30, 255
out 26, r30
ldi r30, \'H\'
out 27, r30
ldi r30, 255
out 26, r30
ldi r30, \'i\'
out 27, r30'" size="auto" reset="yes" simid="0" template="/lib/jsavr/simavr.html"></sim-avr>


<sim-avr text="'hello:
ldi r30, 255
out 26, r30
ldi r30, \'H\'
some_label: 
out 27, r30
ldi r30, 255
babel: 
out 26, r30
ldi r30, \'i\'
out 27, r30'" size="auto" reset="yes" simid="1" template="/lib/jsavr/simavr.html"></sim-avr>

Any such label has a value, which is defined to be the address in
program memory of the first instruction after the label.  So in the
above example, the value of the label <span class="icode">hello</span> is 0, of
<span class="icode">some_label</span> is 3, and of <span class="icode">babel</span> is 5.
  
  </p><p><span id="def_byte directive" class="definition"></span>Labels can also be defined by
    byte or string directives.  A <b>byte directive</b> is a way of
    pre-filling RAM with a given sequence of values, and giving the
    address of those values a name.  Specifically, a byte directive
    looks like:

    
    <div class="code"><pre>.byte(<i>label name</i>) <i>[Comma-separated list of bytes]</i></pre></div>
    
    It will write the given sequence of bytes (separated by commas) in
    the list into RAM at some address and will create a label whose
    value is that address.  </p><p>For example, the directive
    
    <div class="code"><pre>.byte(hello) 12,189,200,0,0</pre></div>
    
    might create the following situation in RAM:</p><table>
      <tr><td><b>Address</b></td><td><b>Value</b></td></tr>
      <tr><td>1231</td><td>12</td></tr>
      <tr><td>1232</td><td>189</td></tr>
      <tr><td>1233</td><td>200</td></tr>
      <tr><td>1234</td><td>0</td></tr>
      <tr><td>1235</td><td>0</td></tr>
    </table><p>In this case, the label <span class="icode">hello</span> will have the
    value 1231.</p><p><span id="def_string directive" class="definition"></span>Finally, exactly analogous to
    the byte directive is the <b>string directive</b>, which looks
    like: 

    <div class="code"><pre>.string(<i>label name</i>) <i>[string]</i></pre></div>

    This will convert each character of the string into its
    corresponding byte, place these bytes into RAM, and create a new
    label whose value is the address of the first byte of this string.
    It will also leave a 0 byte at the end of the string that it
    stores in RAM.  </p><p>For example, the directive
    
    <div class="code"><pre>.string(story) "Once upon a time"</pre></div>
    
    might create the following situation in RAM:</p><table>
      <tr><td><b>Address</b></td><td><b>Value</b></td></tr>
      <tr><td>1904</td><td>79</td></tr>
      <tr><td>1905</td><td>110</td></tr>
      <tr><td>1906</td><td>99</td></tr>
      <tr><td>1907</td><td>101</td></tr>
      <tr><td>1908</td><td>32</td></tr>
      <tr><td>1909</td><td>117</td></tr>
      <tr><td>1910</td><td>112</td></tr>
      <tr><td>1911</td><td>111</td></tr>
      <tr><td>1912</td><td>110</td></tr>
      <tr><td>1913</td><td>32</td></tr>
      <tr><td>1914</td><td>97</td></tr>
      <tr><td>1915</td><td>32</td></tr>
      <tr><td>1916</td><td>116</td></tr>
      <tr><td>1917</td><td>105</td></tr>
      <tr><td>1918</td><td>109</td></tr>
      <tr><td>1919</td><td>101</td></tr>
      <tr><td>1920</td><td>0</td></tr>
    </table><p>In this case, the label <span class="icode">story</span> will have the
    value 1904.</p></div></div><div class="section"><div id="sec_6_2"></div><div class="text"><div class="header">6.2: 
	  ISA Operations</div><p>We have already discussed in detail the syntax and semantics of
  the various ISA operations.  The only thing new in assembly language
  is the ability to replace certain operands with characters or
  labels.  Specifically:
  <ul>
    <li><p>Any operand designated above as an 'offset' can be replaced
    with the name of a label.  This includes the operands to rjmp,
    rcall, and all the branch instructions.  The assembler will then
    compute the difference between the address of the jump/branch
    instruction and the value of the label, and will substitute that
    difference as the actual operand.  </p>

    <p>For example, take the program:

    <sim-avr text="'ldi r31,0
hello:
cpi r31,8
breq stuff
inc r31
rjmp hello
stuff:
dec r31
cpi r31,3
brne stuff'" size="auto" reset="yes" simid="2" template="/lib/jsavr/simavr.html"></sim-avr>

The label <span class="icode">stuff</span> in this program has value 5.  The
<span class="icode">breq stuff</span> instruction occurs at address 2, so in order
to jump from <span class="icode">breq stuff</span> to the instruction after the
<span class="icode">stuff</span> label, the assembler computes that it has to jump
ahead 3 instructions.  This is accomplished by replacing the first
<span class="icode">breq stuff</span> with <span class="icode">breq 2</span> (as, remember,
the PC will get incremented after the instruction runs).  </p>
    
    <p>On the other hand, the instruction <span class="icode">brne stuff</span>
    has address 7, and so to jump back to the label stuff would
    require a jump of -2.  Because (again) branch instructions
    increment the PC, this is accomplished by replacing the
    <span class="icode">brne stuff</span> line with <span class="icode">breq -3</span>.
    Likewise, <span class="icode">rjmp hello</span> gets replaced by <span class="icode">rjmp
    -5</span>.  So the above program is equivalent to:


<sim-avr text="'ldi r31,0  
cpi r31,8  
breq 2  
inc r31  
rjmp -5  
dec r31  
cpi r31,3  
brne -3'" size="auto" reset="yes" simid="3" template="/lib/jsavr/simavr.html"></sim-avr>

Of course, writing the program using labels means we don't have to
adjust all the offsets of our jumps and branches if we change the
program a little, so labels do indeed solve that problem.
    </p>
    </li>
    <li>Any character corresponds to a byte in a standard way.  So
    with just the naive ISA operations, we could already do string
    manipulation by taking any string we wanted to use, figuring out
    which bytes its characters corresponded to, and using those
    numbers in place of the actual string.  This would make the
    purpose of a program rather hard to divine, however.  Imagine:

    <sim-avr text="'ldi r30, 255
out 17, r30
ldi r30, 72
out 18, r30
ldi r30, 255
out 17, r30
ldi r30, 105
out 18, r30'" size="auto" reset="yes" simid="4" template="/lib/jsavr/simavr.html"></sim-avr>

    We know from earlier that this is outputting the numbers 72 and
    105, but these numbers turn out to correspond to the characters
    'H' and 'i', respectively.  So this is outputting the text 'Hi',
    and we can make this more evident by replacing the numbers with
    the characters they correspond to:  

    <sim-avr text="'ldi r30, 255
out 17, r30
ldi r30, \'H\'
out 18, r30
ldi r30, 255
out 18, r30
ldi r30, \'i\'
out 18, r30'" size="auto" reset="yes" simid="5" template="/lib/jsavr/simavr.html"></sim-avr>
    The assembler will turn this into the earlier program anyway,
    since ldi of course requires a number as its second operand, but
    we are free to use characters when they are more convenient than
    the raw numbers and let the assembler take care of the
    conversion.</li>
    
    <li>
      <p>Finally, there is one further piece of syntax that the
      assembler allows.  Imagine we've stored some data in RAM with a
      directive such as:
      
      <div class="code"><pre>.byte(fibonacci) 1,1,2,3,5,8,13,21,34,55</pre></div>

      And say we want to add add up all these numbers (for whatever
      reason--maybe we really want to know what is the sum of the
      first 10 fibonacci numbers).  The value of the label
      <span class="icode">fibonacci</span> is the address in RAM of the first byte
      in this sequence.  If we want to load from this address, then
      remember that this will involve using the <span class="icode">ld</span>
      instruction to load from address X (or Y or Z) into a register.
      So we need to get the value of <span class="icode">fibonacci</span> into,
      say, X.  But we don't have instructions for loading into X
      directly.  We can only use <span class="icode">ldi</span> to load one
      register at a time.  Since X = r27:r26, we'll need two ldi
      instructions: one to get the right value into r26 and one to get
      the right value into r27.  </p>
      
      <p>But what is the right value?  The value of
      <span class="icode">fibonacci</span> is an address in RAM, so is a 16-bit
      number.  We cannot load it into a register directly, then.
      Rather, we want to load the low 8-bits into r26, and the high
      8-bits into r27.  This can be accomplished with the final piece
      of syntax for ISA operations:

      <div class="code"><pre>lo8(<i>label name</i>)</pre></div>

      will refer to the lower 8 bits of the value of a label that
      refers to a RAM address, and

      <div class="code"><pre>hi8(<i>label name</i>)</pre></div> will refer to the high 8
      bits.  </p>
      
      <p>These two can be used in place of any immediate operand.
      Specifically, they can be used as the second operands to ldi,
      ori, cpi, andi, or subi.</p>
      
      <p>Thus:

      <div class="code"><pre>ldi r26,lo8(fibonacci)
ldi r27,hi8(fibonacci)</pre></div>

      will together load the value of <span class="icode">fibonacci</span> into
      X.  </p>
      
      <p>
      For example, if <span class="icode">fibonacci</span> is RAM address 1000,
      then we first compute that 1000 = 3:232.  Or equivalently: As a
      16-bit binary number, 1000 = 0000001111101000, so the high 8
      bits are 00000011 = 3, and the low 8 bits are 11101000 = 232.
      So <span class="icode">lo8(fibonacci)</span> will be 232 and
      <span class="icode">hi8(fibonacci)</span> will be 3, and so the instructions
      
      <div class="code"><pre>ldi r26,lo8(fibonacci)
ldi r27,hi8(fibonacci)</pre></div>
      
will indeed store 1000 into X.
      </p>
    </li>
  </ul>
  </p><p>As we mentioned, the assembler's job is to put numbers into
  program memory corresponding to the specified instructions.  We've
  seen how to specify ISA operations, even using labels and characters
  when convenient, but have not discussed the conversion of ISA
  operations into numbers.  This will be the topic of the next
  chapter, and for now all we mention is that there is some
  correspondence.  For example, the instruction

  <div class="code"><pre>ori r22,88</pre></div>

  corresponds to the number 26725.

	  Word directives</div><p>We have seen how to get values into RAM using byte and string
directives.  <span id="def_word directive" class="definition"></span>There is a further directive,
called a <b>word directive</b>, which has the form

<div class="code"><pre>.word <i>comma-separated list of numbers</i></pre></div>

and is used not to write bytes into RAM, but to write words into
program memory directly.</p><p>Remember that program memory is, at the end of the day, just a
normal width-16 memory, meaning all it stores are numbers 0-65535.
When we write ISA operations these do not get stored directly in
program memory, but are first converted to numbers and stored.  The
computer then is designed to interpret these numbers as tasks that it
should perform.  In the next chapter, we will learn precisely how
instructions correspond to numbers by learning what is called the
ISA's "encoding."  However, for now, we can at least see what numbers
correspond to various instructions by using the simulator's "decimal"
view of program memory.  </p><p>For example, let us look back to the 3x+1 program from earlier:

<sim-avr text="'ldi r16,20
ldi r17,1
ldi r31,-1
out 17,r31
out 18,r16
cp r16,r17

mov r18,r16
andi r18,1
cp r18,r17
breq 2
asr r16
rjmp -9
mov r19,r16
add r19,r19
add r16,r19
inc r16
rjmp -14'" size="auto" reset="yes" simid="6" template="/lib/jsavr/simavr.html"></sim-avr>

If you run this example and then, in the box for the program memory,
click the "[dec]" button, you will see the actual numbers that gets
stored in program memory for these instructions.  In this case, we see
the following sequence of numbers stored: 

<div class="code"><pre>57604  
57361  
61439  
47903  
47904  
5889  
61529  
12064  
28705  
5921

53239  
12080  
3891  
3843
38147  
53234</pre></div>

The word directive lets us simply insert these numbers into the
program memory directly rather than writing mnemonics for the
instructions.  For example, the following is another way of writing
the 3x+1 program:

<sim-avr text="'.word 57604,57361,61439,47903,47904,5889,61529,12064,28705,5921,61457,38149,53239,12080,3891,3843,38147,53234'" size="auto" reset="yes" simid="7" template="/lib/jsavr/simavr.html"></sim-avr>

	  Python-to-assembly recipes</div><p>Since Python never actually runs on a computer, but is simply
translated into the ISA, it must be true that everything we could do
in Python, we can do in the ISA.  Since assembly translates directly
to the ISA, we only need to substantiate the claim that everything we
can do in Python, we could instead do in assembly language.  To this
end, we shall take a few constructs from Python and see how they can
be realized using SimpleAVR assembly language in this section.  In effect,
we will manually be doing the job of a compiler in order to start to
learn how a compiler does what it does.</p></div></div><div class="section"><div id="sec_6_4_1"></div><div class="text"><div class="header">6.4.1: 
	  Assignment</div><p>Recall that assignment lines in Python were our principal means
  for performing storage and computation operations.  Take, for example:

  <div class="code"><pre>x = 18-(5+1)</pre></div>

  In the ISA, we have two choices for where to store values like this:
  we can use registers or we can use RAM.  But remember that to store
  something in RAM, we had to first have it in a register anyway, and
  then we would use a <span class="icode">st</span> instruction to get it into
  RAM.  </p><p>To store a value in a register, we have the <span class="icode">ldi</span>
  instruction, but we cannot do, for example,

  <div class="code"><pre>ldi r16,18-(5+1)</pre></div>

  since ldi accepts only numbers -127 through 128 as its operands and
  not sums or any complex expression of any kind.  Rather, these
  expressions need to be computed with further ISA operations.
  Typically, we would start by storing something from the inner-most
  part of the expression.  In this case, that might be 5:

  <div class="code"><pre>ldi r16,5</pre></div>

  and then performing various further operations on this to execute
  the steps outlined by the expression.  For example, the next thing
  is to add 1 to this value, which we can do with the
  <span class="icode">inc</span> instruction:

  <div class="code"><pre>ldi r16,5
inc r16</pre></div>

Then we need to negate what we have:

  <div class="code"><pre>ldi r16,5
inc r16
neg r16</pre></div>

  Finally, we need to add 18 to it.  Since the add instruction
  requires its second operand to be a register, we need to put 18 in
  another register first, and then we can add it to r16:
  
  <div class="code"><pre>ldi r16,5
inc r16
neg r16
ldi r17,18
add r16,r17</pre></div>

This seems like a lot of work for the same result, and indeed it is a
lot more code.  High-level languages exist to prevent programmers from
having to write such tedious lists of operations to get even simple
things done.  The point of the ISA isn't to actually write
large programs using it (though one can, and indeed, historically many
people have).  Rather, the point of the ISA is that it can both
express all the computations we want to be able to do (however
clumsily) <i>and</i> it can be actually run by a physical machine.
After all, what good is a high-level programming langauge if the
programmer has to manually walk through the steps of running it?  </p></div></div><div class="section"><div id="sec_6_4_2"></div><div class="text"><div class="header">6.4.2: 
	  Large numbers</div><p>We've seen how to take assignment lines in Python and break up
  their expressions into computational steps performed by the ISA.
  Sometimes in Python, however, these computations would yield very
  large numbers.  In the simplest case,

  <div class="code"><pre>x = 999999999</pre></div>

  is a perfectly valid line of Python code that will work as you would
  expect.  By contrast, all ISA operations only act on registers,
  which, in turn, only store numbers up to 255.  So how can we
  possibly turn a line like the above into ISA operations?</p><p>In fact we've already see some hints of this: RAM addresses were
  numbers larger than 255 sometimes, and so we used combinations of
  registers such as Z = r31:r30 to deal with these.  In general, the
  method for handling larger numbers is to use a collection of
  registers as all together to store the various parts of a single
  large number.  For example, in binary:

  <div class="code"><pre>999999999 = 111011100110101100100111111111</pre></div>

  We can break this up into bytes:
  
  <div class="code"><pre>00111011:10011010:11001001:11111111 = 59:154:201:255</pre></div>

  and we can store each of these bytes in separate registers, say r16
  through r19, where r16 stores the least significant bits and r19 the
  most:

  <div class="code"><pre>ldi r16,255
ldi r17,201
ldi r18,154
  ldi r19,59</pre></div>
  </p><p>However, just being able to store a large number is not
  enough--we want to be able to do things like add two such numbers.
  Say r16-r19 are being used to store one such number, and r20-r23 are
  being used to store another.  We have an ISA instruction to add a
  register to a register, but not one to add a four-register number to
  another four-register number.  </p><p>One first guess might be that we can add the constituent
  registers individually using the add instruction:

  <div class="code"><pre>add r16,r20
add r17,r21
add r18,r22
add r19,r23</pre></div>

  This actually works in certain cases: for instance, for adding the
  numbers 1:1:1:1 = 16843009 and 4:3:2:1 = 67305985, if we simply add
  the constituent registers, we get 5:4:3:2 = 84148994, which is the
  sum of the two represented numbers.</p><p>Essentially this will work until we try to add the registers and
  we get an overflow.  For the simplest example, suppose we are trying
  to add 0:0:0:255 = 255 and 0:0:0:1 = 1.  In this case, adding the
  registers individually yields and answer of 0:0:0:0 = 0, rather than
  the desired answer of 256 = 0:0:1:0.  </p><p>The solution reflects the addition procedure many people are
  taught in grade school: To add two numbers, you don't just add their
  digits blindly, but you add the digits and you "carry the 1" over to
  the next pair of digits if need be.  In our case, when we add two
  registers, if there is a carry, the C flag in the sreg gets set, and
  in that case, the sum of the next two registers also needs a 1 added
  to it.  But this is precisely what the adc instruction does!  So all
  we have to do is:

  <div class="code"><pre>add r16,r20
adc r17,r21
adc r18,r22
adc r19,r23</pre></div></p><p>This whole scheme might seem a little uncomfortable--we're not
  actually storing the large numbers we claim to be, but simply
  storing pieces and somehow "understanding" those pieces to
  collectively represent the big numbers.  In a sense, though, this
  isn't unlike how we when we write down the number "3889", we write
  it as four separate parts: "3", "8", "8", and "9", and somehow that
  represents the number three-thousand eight-hundred eighty-nine.

	  if statements</div><p>In Python, we had an easy way of executing certain chunks of code
  conditionally using the if-else construct.  For example, if we have
  two variables x and y and we want one chunk of code to run if they
  are equal and a different chunk to run if they are not equal, we
  could do: </p><div class="code"><pre>if (x == y):
   <i>stuff to do if equal</i>
else:
   <i>stuff to do if not equal</i></pre></div><p>In assembly, we don't have such a construct, but we can mimic
   its behavior using our conditional branches--specifically breq
   which branches if the Z flag is set.  Broadly, the structure of
   such a program would look like: </p><div class="code"><pre><i>compare the two numbers and set the Z flag if they're equal</i>
breq jump_here_if_equal
<i>stuff to do if not equal</i>
<i>jump to end_of_conditional_code (so that we don't also do the stuff to do if equal)</i>
jump_here_if_equal:
<i>stuff to do if equal</i>
end_of_conditional_code:</pre></div><p>Under this setup, if the numbers are equal, then the branch skips
over the things we want to happen if they aren't equal.  On the other
hand, if they weren't equal, then the branch is not taken and the code
goes straight into the stuff that should happen if they are not equal,
but then at the end of that code, it jumps over the code following,
which should only happen if the two numbers were equal.  </p><p>Replacing English descriptions with assembly language where
possible, we get: </p><div class="code"><pre>cp r0,r1
breq jump_here_if_equal
<i>stuff to do if not equal</i>
rjmp end_of_conditional_code
jump_here_if_equal:
<i>stuff to do if equal</i>
end_of_conditional_code:</pre></div><p>We can easily modify this to represent different tests such as

<div class="code"><pre>if(x &gt;= y)</pre></div>

or

<div class="code"><pre>if(x &lt; y)</pre></div>

by changing the branch to, say, brge, or brlo, as we shall see in our
examples section.</p></div></div><div class="section"><div id="sec_6_4_4"></div><div class="text"><div class="header">6.4.4: 
	  while loops</div><p>Similarly, the Python while loop construct allowed us to repeat a
  chunk of code for as long as a given condition remained true.  For
  example, to do some things as long as two variables x and y have the
  same values: </p><div class="code"><pre>while(x == y):
   <i>do stuff</i></pre></div><p>To do this in assembly (again supposing that the two numbers we wish
to compare are stored in registers r0 and r1), we can use branches and
jumps again.  For example, we could say "First test if r0 and r1
are different.  If not, the continue on to the 'do stuff' code, after
which we should jump back to the comparison at we started with.  If
they were different, on the other hand, we should branch to the end of
the whole thing."</p><p>In code: </p><div class="code"><pre>begin_loop:
cp r0,r1
brne end_loop
<i>do stuff</i>
rjmp begin_loop
end_loop:</pre></div><p>In general, if we have a while loop like:

  
  <div class="code"><pre>while(<i>test</i>):
   <i>do stuff</i></pre></div>

   then the translation to assembly will look like:

   
<div class="code"><pre>begin_loop:
<i>run the test</i>
<i>branch to end_while if the test failed</i>
<i>do stuff</i>
rjmp begin_loop
end_loop:</pre></div>

So, for example, if our loop is:

<div class="code"><pre>while(x &gt; y):
   <i>do stuff</i></pre></div>

then in assembly, (supposing we've stored x in r16 and y in r17) we
would compare x and y with <span class="icode">cp</span> instruction.  Now, we
want to skip to the end of the loop if x is not greater than y.  That
is, if y &gt;= x.  Recall from the table at the end of section 5.4.6 that
we can test if r17 &gt;= r16 by

<div class="code"><pre>cp r17,r16
brsh ...</pre></div>

thus our loop should look like:

<div class="code"><pre>begin_loop:
cp r17,r16
brsh end_loop
<i>do stuff</i>
rjmp begin_loop
end_loop:</pre></div>

</p></div></div><div class="section"><div id="sec_6_4_5"></div><div class="text"><div class="header">6.4.5: 
	  Functions</div><p>The basic idea of functions in Python was to have a chunk of code
  that could be called on to execute at various times throughout the
  program.  In pure ISA, we've seen that we could accomplish a similar
  thing with rcall and ret.  Now that we have learned how to more
  easily create the offsets for things like rcall using labels, we can
  revisit functions using assembly language to come up with a reasonably
  organized pattern for translating general Python functions to
  machine code.</p><p>Consider, for example, a function in Python like this:

  <div class="code"><pre>def f(x):
   return 3*x+1</pre></div>

   In assembly, we first need a piece of code that performs the
   calculation that the function does.  Suppose r16 is the register
   that stores x.  Then this might look like:

   <div class="code"><pre>mov r1,r31
add r31,r31
add r31,r1
inc r31</pre></div>

   Then, to place this in a function, we'll put a label at the start
   which we can use to call it later, and a <span class="icode">ret</span>
   instruction at the end so that after we've called it, we can return
   from it to whatever we were doing before:

   <div class="code"><pre>f:
mov r1,r31
add r31,r31
add r31,r1
inc r31
ret</pre></div>

   This function assumes that r31 contains the number that we want to
   triple and then increment.  However notice that this code also
   overwrites whatever was in r1.  In general, the fewer registers we
   overwrite, the better, so we can have this code push r1 before it
   runs (saving its original value) and then pop r1 before it returns
   (restoring its original value):

   <div class="code"><pre>f:
push r1
mov r1,r31
add r31,r31
add r31,r1
inc r31
pop r1
ret</pre></div>

  </p><p>
   Finally, this code has to go somewhere.  A common choice would be
   at the beginning of our program.  So the full Python program

  <div class="code"><pre>def f(x):
   return 3*x+1

x = f(27)</pre></div>
 
   might look like: 

   <div class="code"><pre>f:
push r1
mov r1,r31
add r31,r31
add r31,r1
inc r31
pop r1
ret
ldi r31,27
rcall f</pre></div>

   But wait!  This way, the first thing this program does will be to
   run the function's code.  We want the <span class="icode">ldi r31,27</span>
   instruction to be run first.  If we put our functions at the start
   of the program, then we have to make sure the first instruction in
   the program jumps over all the function code:

   <div class="code"><pre>rjmp real_program_start
f:
push r1
mov r1,r31
add r31,r31
add r31,r1
inc r31
pop r1
ret

real_program_start:
ldi r31,27
rcall f</pre></div>

   There is one more problem, though.  We're using the stack, so we
   should set the stack pointer to have some sensible value.  Earlier,
   we picked 5000 = 19:136, so we'll use this again.  Thus the program
   will first set the stack pointer then it will jump over all the
   function code, then getting to the real meat of the program.  Thus
   our final functioning compiled version of the simple Python program
   will be: 

   <sim-avr text="'ldi r31, 136
out 61, r31  ; set SPL to 136
ldi r31, 19
out 62, r31  ; set SPH to 19
eor r31,r31  ; Set r31 back to 0
rjmp real_program_start
f:
push r1
mov r1,r31
add r31,r31
add r31,r1
inc r31
pop r1
ret

real_program_start:
ldi r31,27
rcall f'" size="auto" reset="yes" simid="8" template="/lib/jsavr/simavr.html"></sim-avr>


   This way, we can have multiple functions at the beginning and can
   simply jump over them all.  For example, another piece of code that
   we've used a lot is the "output a number code":

   <div class="code"><pre>ldi r30,255
out 17,r30
out 18,<i>value to be outputted</i></pre></div>

   This kind of behaves like the print function did in Python, so if
   we were trying to compile to assembly the Python program:

   <div class="code"><pre>def f(x):
   return 3*x+1

print(f(27))</pre></div>
 
   then we would need two functions: <span class="icode">f</span> (which we
   compiled above) and <span class="icode">print</span>, which might be translated
   similarly as:

   
   <div class="code"><pre>print: 
push r30      ; save r30, since we will use it
ldi r30,255
out 17,r30    ; set D to output mode
out 18,r31    ; output the argument
pop r31
ret</pre></div>

	  Strings and arrays</div><p>While registers are often used for storing single values that are
  being used in computation, the entire register file can only store
  32 bytes in total.  So if we want to perform the kinds of work that
  we ultimately wanted to do in Python, with longer sections of text
  and with arrays, we will need more storage than that.  For strings
  and arrays, then, we use RAM.  </p><p>We've already seen how to get a string or a sequence of bytes
  into RAM using the <span class="icode">.string</span> and <span class="icode">.byte</span>
  directives.  But we will want to do more than just store strings and
  arrays.  We want to be able to concatenate them, find their lengths,
  test if two of them are the same, find values inside them, and so
  on.  We'll save some of these for the next section, but we'll
  discuss lengths and concatenation in this section to get a feel for
  working with data stored in RAM.</p><p><b>String length</b>: Let's start by writing a string length
  function.  That is, say we placed have the string "Mangoes are yummy." in
  RAM:

  <div class="code"><pre>.string(fact) "Mangoes are yummy."</pre></div>

  Then the value of the label <span class="icode">fact</span> will be the address
  of the start of this string in RAM.  Remember that the string
  directive also appends a 0 byte to the end of the string, so if we
  want to find the length of the string, we can start at the beginning
  and walk through until we see a 0.</p><p>In Python, this would be done with a while loop--something like:

<div class="code"><pre>while(<i>character</i> != 0):
   <i>go to the next character</i></pre></div>

   And we just learned how to translate while loops into assembly.  In
   this case, it will look like:

<div class="code"><pre><i>get the first character</i>
search_loop:
cp <i>first character</i>,0
breq end_of_search_loop
<i>get the next character</i>
rjmp search_loop
end_of_search_loop:  </pre></div>

   So: 

  <sim-avr text="'.string(fact) &quot;Mangoes are yummy.&quot;
ldi r30,lo8(fact)
ldi r31,hi8(fact)   ; Now the start of the string is stored in Z
ld r16,Z            ; Get the first character of the string
search_loop:
cpi r16,0
breq end_of_search_loop
ld r16,Z+           ; Put the current character of the string into r16 and increment Z
rjmp search_loop
end_of_search_loop:  '" size="auto" reset="yes" simid="10" template="/lib/jsavr/simavr.html"></sim-avr>

Once we're at the end of the loop, Z will hopefully be the address of
the end of the string.  Sadly, because of the post-incrementing, it
will actually 1 greater than that, so we should subtract 1 from it
immediately after.  Recall we can do this with:

<div class="code"><pre>ldi r28,1
ldi r29,0
sub r30,r28
sbc r31,r29</pre></div>

After this, Z will actually be the address of the end of the string.
So now what?  Since the length of the string should be the difference
between the start and end addresses, we want to compute <span class="icode">Z -
fact</span> to get the length of the string.
</p><p>To begin with, we'd need to get the value of <span class="icode">fact</span>
  into registers so that we can begin to compute with it:

  <div class="code"><pre>ldi r28,lo8(fact)
ldi r29,hi8(fact)</pre></div>

   Then we need to subtract r29:r28 from r31:r30.  Analogously to how
   we added large numbers comprised of several registers, we can
   subtract them:

   <div class="code"><pre>sub r30,r28
sbc r31,r29</pre></div>

leaving us with the code:

  <sim-avr text="'.string(fact) &quot;Mangoes are yummy.&quot;
ldi r30,lo8(fact)
ldi r31,hi8(fact)   ; Now the start of the string is stored in Z
ld r16,Z            ; Get the first character of the string
search_loop:
cpi r16,0
breq end_of_search_loop
ld r16,Z+           ; Put the current character of the string into r16 and increment Z
rjmp search_loop
end_of_search_loop:  
ldi r28,1
ldi r29,0
sub r30,r28
sbc r31,r29

ldi r29,hi8(fact)
sub r30,r28
sbc r31,r29'" size="auto" reset="yes" simid="11" template="/lib/jsavr/simavr.html"></sim-avr>

At the end of this, Z will store the length of the string.

We can wrap this as a function that takes now both r31 and r30 as
arguments and modifies them so that r31:r30 is the length of the
string at the provided address:

<div class="code"><pre>string_length:
push r16

    <b>Array length: </b>OK, so we could get the lengths of strings.
    What about more general arrays, such as:

    <div class="code"><pre>.byte(fibonacci) 1,1,2,3,5,8,13,21,34,55</pre></div>

    Unlike the .string directive, the .byte directive does not store a
    0 at the end of the bytes.  The reason is that this would not
    necessarily be meaningful: It is perfectly valid to store an array
    with 0s in it:
    
    <div class="code"><pre>.byte(digits_of_aperys_constant) 1,2,0,2,0,5,6,9,0,3,1,5,9,5,9,4</pre></div>

    So how can we find the end of an array if there's no way to tell
    if we're at the end of the array?  The answer is that we cannot:
    Unlike strings, simply the starting address of an array is not
    enough to let us find its length.  So for an array, we would need
    to somehow store the length or the ending address as well.  One
    way to do this would be to simply put it in RAM: 
    
    <div class="code"><pre>.byte(length_of_digits_of_aperys_constant) 16
.byte(digits_of_aperys_constant) 1,2,0,2,0,5,6,9,0,3,1,5,9,5,9,4</pre></div>

One feature of this technique is that if we ever want to modify the
array--deleting or adding an element--we also have to update the
stored length.  This is fine, but it does cause us to worry: what if
we add so many elements that we cannot fit the length in a single
byte?  We could protect against this case by storing two bytes for the
length:
  
    <div class="code"><pre>.byte(length_of_digits_of_aperys_constant) 0,16
.byte(digits_of_aperys_constant) 1,2,0,2,0,5,6,9,0,3,1,5,9,5,9,4</pre></div>

where now for the purpose of updating the array we'll treat these two
  bytes as a 16-bit number.</p><div class="warning"><b>Warning: Strings need metadata too</b><p>Now that we did all
  that work to compute the lengths of strings and then we simply
  cheated our way out of doing the same for arrays we could ask: Why
  can't we just also store the length of a string?  The answer is that
  we actually can!  Moreover, it is almost uniformly more efficient to
  do so.  </p>

  <p>We introduce both techniques because there are programming
  languages (most notably, one called C), in which strings are
  actually stored as sequences of characters followed by a 0 byte.
  When working with such languages, it can be important to realize
  that something as simple as asking for the length of the string may
  actually involve a large number of operations to walk the entire
  length of the string looking for the 0 byte.  </p>
  
  <p>This is one famous example of where the abstraction of a
  high-level programming language can leak very badly.  Doing
  <span class="icode">len(my_string)</span> in Python (which does separately store
  the lengths of its strings), and <span class="icode">strlen(my_string)</span> in
  C, while they look very similar and do the same thing, will actually
  take very different amounts of time.</p></div><p><b>Deleting an element from an array</b>: Say we've got an array
  like <span class="icode">2,3,5,7,0,11,13,0,17</span> and we want to remove the
  first 0 from it.  </p><p>Well, what does this actually look like in RAM?  We are starting
  with the situation like: </p><table><tr><td>Address:</td><td>1024</td><td>1025</td><td>1026</td><td>1027</td><td>1028</td><td>1029</td><td>1030</td><td>1031</td><td>1032</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Value:</td><td>2</td><td>3</td><td>5</td><td>7</td><td>0</td><td>11</td><td>13</td><td>0</td><td>17</td></tr>
  </table><p>and end up with the situation: </p><table><tr><td>Address:</td><td>1024</td><td>1025</td><td>1026</td><td>1027</td><td>1028</td><td>1029</td><td>1030</td><td>1031</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Value:</td><td>2</td><td>3</td><td>5</td><td>7</td><td>11</td><td>13</td><td>0</td><td>17</td></tr>
  </table><p>so while it seems like a small operation, what we see is that the
  value at RAM address 1029 has to be moved to RAM address 1028, the
  value at 1030 has to be moved to 1029, and so on.  So actually, this
  simple operation requires us to shuffle around half the elements of
  the list.  (And then, of course, we have to decrement its length.)</p><p>So let's suppose we are writing a function to do this.  It will
  take as input r31 and r30 giving the address of the start of the
  array, and also r29,r28 the address where the length is stored, and
  finally r16 will be the index we wish to delete.  </p><p>Then the algorithm will be:

  <ol>
    <li>Set a counter to be length - index.  This is how many things we have to copy</li>
    <li>Add the index to Z</li>
    <li>Store Z in X.  X will be the address we are writing to</li>
    <li>Increment Z.  Now X will always be 1 behind Z</li>
    <li>While the counter &gt;= 0:
    <ol>
      <li>Read from Z into a temporary location</li>
      <li>Increment Z</li>
      <li>Write the temporary value into X</li>
      <li>Increment X</li>
      <li>Decrement the counter</li>
    </ol>

    </li>
  </ol>

  Translating this to assembly, we'll let the counter be r17 and the
  "temporary location" used in the loop be r18, then the rest of this
  translates rather straightforwardly:

  <div class="code"><pre>array_delete:
push r17
push r18
push r19
ld r17,Y      ; Y is the counter address, so now r17 is the length
sub r17,r16   ; r16 is the index, so now r17 is length - index
ldi r18,0     ; we need this to compute index + Z
add r30,r0
adc r31,r17   ; Z += index
mov r26,r30
mov r27,r30   ; X = Z
ldi r18,1
ldi r19,0     ; now r19:r18 = 1 and we can add this to Z to increment it
add r30,r18
adc r31,r19   ; Z = Z + 1
loop_start:
cpi r17,0
breq loop_end ; if r17 == 0 then we are done
ld r18,Z+     ; read Z into temp location and then increment Z

dec r17       ; decrement the counter
loop_end:

<div class="warning"><b>Warning: Arrays and frequent deletion don't mix</b>
  <p>Ultimately, the lesson here is that while deleting an element of
  an array might look like a very simple operation, it in fact
  requires us to shift the entire array following the element we're
  deleting.  Imagine if we had a string of the text of an entire book
  and we were deleting the first letter.  That would require moving
  all the other letters one step back!</p>
  
  <p>In general, if we have <span class="icode">k</span> things to delete from an
  array of <span class="icode">N</span> elements, then we might think that this
  will take <span class="icode">k</span> steps--one for each deletion.  In fact it
  may take as many as <span class="icode">k*N</span> steps, as each deletion may
  require shifting up to N elements of the array.</p>
  
  <p>For this reason, using simple arrays like those we have described
  to store data that will require many deletions of elements is
  actually quite inefficient.  There are other, cleverer ways to store
  data that may require many delete operations.  One way that suits
  this purpose is called a "linked list", where the elements of the
  list are stored in possibly completely unrelated locations in RAM,
  but each element also includes the RAM address of the next
  element.  This way, to delete element number 4 in the list, we only
  need to update the "next element" address stored with element 3 to
  be the address of element 5.</p>
  
  <p>This is just one example of how the particular scheme used for
  storing data can very meaningfully affect efficiency, and of how
  what you want to do with the data can affect how you decide to store
  it.  There are many schemes for storing data, all tailored to
  slightly different use-cases.  Such schemes are called "data
  structures", and you may have an entire class to learn about some of
  them (and maybe you will even design your own!) in your future
  computer programming life.</p>
</div>
</p><p><b>Comparing strings</b>: What about just comparing two strings?
  Maybe we have two strings in RAM--one that the user typed in and the
  other, a password.  We then want to see if they match in order to
  authenticate the user.  In Python we could just do something like:

  <div class="code"><pre>if(password_entered == password_stored):
   <i>do stuff</i></pre></div>

  We've already seen how to compare numbers like this in assembly
  using the cp operation, but haven't yet seen this for strings.  </p><p><b>Algorithm: </b></p><p>The idea isn't too far removed, however, from comparing numbers.
  After all, strings are just sequences of numbers.  So if we have
  strings stored at, say, addresses 200 and 650 in RAM, then we can
  start by comparing the numbers at those addresses.  If they don't
  match, then the strings are definitely different.  But if they do
  match, then we need to compare the numbers at addresses 201 and 651.
  Then the numbers at 202 and 652.  If at any point we don't get a
  match, then we know the strings are different.  If, on the other
  hand, the two numbers match and are both 0, then that means we
  reached the end of both strings simultaneously, and so we're
  done, and only then can we conclude that the strings themselves
  actually match</p><p>Put into steps:

  <ol>
    <li>Put Y = [address of string 1]</li>
    <li>Put Z = [address of string 2]</li>
    <li>Read RAM address Y into r0 and increment Y</li>
    <li>Read RAM address Z into r1 and increment Z</li>
    <li>Compare r0 and r1</li>
    <li>
      If they're the same, do the following:
      <ol>
	<li>Compare r0 with 0</li>
	<li>If they're the same, then the strings are equal!</li>
      </ol>
    </li>
    <li>Jump back to step 3</li>
    <li>If we've got here, then the strings differ</li>
  </ol>

  We only have to decide what to do if the strings differ.  Lets say
  we'll return the answer in r31: It will be 1 if they are the same,
  and 0 if they are different.  </p><p><b>Program: </b></p><p>Turning the above into a program is relatively straightforward,

  concatenation.  Say we've put two arrays--or even two strings--into
  RAM like:

  <div class="code"><pre>.string(string1) "'Tis hard to say, if greater want of skill\nAppear in writing or in judging ill;\n"
.string(string2) "But, of the two, less dang'rous is th' offence\nTo tire our patience, than mislead our sense."</pre></div>

   These two strings occur at separate locations in RAM, potentially
   with other things in between them.  We want to construct a single
   string that consists of the contents of string 1 followed by the
   contents of string 2, say followed by a 0 (as is the convention
  with strings).  </p><p>Once we phrase the problem this way, a procedure presents
  itself rather simply:
  
  <ol>
    <li>Find a free space in RAM</li>
    <li>Copy string1 to that space</li>
    <li>Copy string2 to that space, starting at the end of string1</li>
  </ol>

  So first of all, how do we find a free spot in RAM to put our
  combined string?  Well, directives start filling RAM at address
  1024, and the bottom of the stack is at 5000 (so the stack occupies
  only address 5000 and below).  So this should leave any addresses
  above 5000 free for use.  </p><p>But we cannot just always use 5001 as a free address.  The first
  time we want to concatenate in a program, this will be fine, but the
  second time it will not--that space will be used by the result of
  our first concatenation!  So we can start at 5001, but if our first
  concatenation uses 100 bytes, then our next concatenation should
  start at address 5101.  So when we do anything with that space above
  5000, we should always keep track of how much we've used so far.  To
  do this, we'll mark off a spot in RAM to store for this address.
  Since we have to store the address in bytes, we compute 5001 =
  19:137 and then store: 

  <div class="code"><pre>.byte(first_free_address) 19,137</pre></div>

  So now the algorithm can be made more precise:
  
  <ol>
    <li>Load <span class="icode">first_free_address</span> into X</li>
    <li>Load address of string1 into Y</li>
    <li>Loop through the characters starting at Y, copying them to
    address X and incrementing X along the way, until we see a 0</li>
    <li>Load address of string2 into Y</li>
    <li>Loop through the characters starting at Y, copying them to
    address X and incrementing X along the way, until we see a 0</li>
    <li>Put a 0 at the current address X and increment X one last time
    (so it points to the address just after the 0)</li>
    <li>Store the current value of X at address <span class="icode">first_free_address</span></li>
  </ol>
  </p><p>We can then start converting this to code immediately:

    <p>Note that to concatenate two arrays meant copying the contents
    of both of them!  This means that our harmless little "append an
    element to an array" code from chapter 3:

    <span class="icode">my_array += [6]</span>

    may not just be a single ISA operation to plop 6 at the end of the
    array, but might require a whole copy of the entire array first!
    Now, if we knew in advance that we were going to have to append
    things to our array, we could ensure that enough bytes after the
    array in RAM are also unused so that we could just plop the right
    values immediately after the array and append to it that way.</p>
    
    <p>Once again, the details of exactly how our data is stored
    (beyond what we can see just by knowing the high-level prgramming
    language) can affect the efficiency of our high-level programs and
    what code we write.</p>
  </div><div class="aside"><b>Aside: Free RAM is expensive</b>
    <p>In the above algorithm, we had this step of "Find some unused
    area in RAM", and we dispatched it in a relatively simple way:
    Have a single barrier above which everything is considered
    "unused" and below which everything is "used".  This is great if
    there is unlimited RAM and our program is simple, but real
    computers have to deal with a circumstance where a program might
    use some RAM for a while and then decide it no longer needs that
    RAM.</p>

    <p>For example, suppose we did a concatenation which used 100
    bytes, taking up the space from 5001 through 5100.  Then we did
    another concatenation using the next 100 bytes from 5101 to 5200.
    Then we decided we were done using te bytes 5001 to 5100 (maybe we
    printed that string out to the user and no longer need to store
    it, say).  </p>
    
    <p>We would like in these circumtances to keep track of the fact
    that next time we need some unused RAM (provided we ask for 100
    bytes or fewer) we have the option of using the byte 5101 to 5100,
    rather than just continuing onward from 5201 where we left
    off.</p>

    <p>In general, there might be many small chunks of unused RAM in
    our "heap" of used RAM, and keeping track of all of them in a
    non-wasteful way is a challenging problem whose solutions can make
    use of quite complicated data structures.  Code that controls this
    process is called a "memory allocator", which you may learn about
    if your studies take you in the direction of learning about
    operating systems or the C programming language.</p>

  instead: Given an n, compute 1+2+3+...+n.  </p><p><b>Python program: </b></p><p>Having done the factorial example earlier, we can quite readily
  imagine a Python program doing this task.  We would have a variable
  storing n, a counter variable that starts at 1, and a variable for
  storing the sum.  We could then use a while loop that increments the
  counter until it reaches n, and on each iteration of the loop it
  adds the counter to the variable storing the sum.  To wit:

  <div class="code"><pre>n = 20
counter = 1
sum = 0
while(counter &lt;= n):
   sum = sum + counter
   counter = counter + 1
print(sum)</pre></div>

  </p><p><b>Converting to assembly: </b> The first three lines are
  assignment lines that store numbers.  This directly translates to
  ldi instructions as long as we pick some registers to play the roles
  of <span class="icode">n</span>, <span class="icode">counter</span>, and
  <span class="icode">sum</span>.  Since ldi can only load into registers r16 and
  up, we'll pick r16, r17, and r18 for these:

  <div class="code"><pre>ldi r16,20
ldi r17,1
ldi r18,0</pre></div>

  </p><p>Now, the next portion is a while loop.  We've seen that we can
  get this behavior using the ISA with a structure like:

<div class="code"><pre>begin_while:
<i>do comparison</i>
<i>[branch if condition fails]</i> end_while
<i>do stuff</i>
rjmp begin_while
end_while:</pre></div>

  Here, the condition is <span class="icode">counter &lt;= n</span>.  This means
  the condition fails if <span class="icode">counter &gt; n</span>.  We saw earlier
  (at the end of 5.4.6) that the comparison <span class="icode">r17 &gt; r16</span>
  could be tested with:

  <div class="code"><pre>cpi r16,r17
brlo ...</pre></div>

  (This is testing "is r17 the same as or higher than r16", i.e., <span class="icode">r17 &gt;= r16</span> which
  is equivalent to the condition in question.)

</p><p>Thus our code now looks like:

<div class="code"><pre>ldi r16,20
ldi r17,1    ; r17 will store the counter
ldi r18,0    ; r18 will store the sum
begin_while:
cp r16,r17
brlo end_while
<i>do stuff</i>
rjmp begin_while
end_while:</pre></div>

   So all that remains is to figure out what "do stuff" should be.
   But this is relatively straightforward: Since the sum is r18 and
   the counter is r17, <span class="icode">sum = sum+counter</span> can just be
   <span class="icode">add r18,r17</span>, and <span class="icode">counter = counter+1</span>
   can just be <span class="icode">inc r17</span>.  Thus:


<sim-avr text="'ldi r16,20
ldi r17,1    ; r17 will store the counter
ldi r18,0    ; r18 will store the sum
begin_while:
cp r16,r17
brlo end_while
add r18,r17
inc r17
rjmp begin_while
end_while:'" size="auto" reset="yes" simid="15" template="/lib/jsavr/simavr.html"></sim-avr>   

  </p><p><b>Debrief: </b>

Note that 1+2+...+22 is the largest such sum we can compute without
overflow.  We could have stored the sum using two registers such as
r19:r18 to compute much larger sums.</p><p><b>Assembly, mark II: </b> This time, we'll try to get the sum from
1 to 100.  This will require the use of 16 bits to store the sum
(i.e., at least two registers).  To choose at random, we'll have r17
store the counter, and r31:r30 store the sum:

<sim-avr text="'ldi r16,100
ldi r17,1    ; counter = 1
ldi r30,0
ldi r31,0    ; sum = r31:r30 = 0:0 = 0
begin_while:
cp r16,r17   
brlo end_while
; We shall add r17 to r31:r30, but the usual method
; requires adding numbers of the same width, so we
; set up r18 as 0 so that r18:r17 is just the 16-bit
; version of r17:
ldi r18,0    
add r30,r17
adc r31,r18  ; r31:r30 = r31:r30 + r18:r17
inc r17
rjmp begin_while
end_while:'" size="auto" reset="yes" simid="16" template="/lib/jsavr/simavr.html"></sim-avr>

Note that because we've used r31:r30, we can view the counter's
progress in the Z register.

</p><p><b>Debrief: </b>

Unlike factorial, there is a simple formula for the sum of the first n
integers, namely n*(n+1)/2.  We already know how to divide by 2 using
asr, so if we knew how to multiply registers this might have been a
lot simpler.  We'll explore this business in the next example.</p></div></div><div class="section"><div id="sec_6_5_2"></div><div class="text"><div class="header">6.5.2: 
	  Multiplication</div><p><b>Introduction: </b> The SimpleAVR instruction set does include an
  instruction called mul for multiplying registers, but many cheaper
  SimpleAVR chips you can buy do not actually support this instruction.  So
  if we want to multiply numbers, we have to do it ourselves.</p><p>One issue that arises is that multiplying numbers is a good way
  to get large numbers: it is likely that even if we only multiply two
  single-register numbers, the result will not fit in a register.  For
  example, 20*20 = 400 which is already too big.  So in this case
  we're almost forced to store the result in two registers.</p><p><b>Python program: </b> Otherwise, the most obvious algorithm
  seems like a straightforward loop: To compute <span class="icode">a*b</span> we
  simply start with storing 0 somewhere and add <span class="icode">b</span> to it
  <span class="icode">a</span> times (say, using a while loop with a counter):

  <div class="code"><pre>product = 0
counter = 0
while(counter &lt; a):
   product = product + b
   counter = counter + 1</pre></div>

   If we decide the product should be stored in r31:r30 and the
   counter will be r19, <span class="icode">a</span> will be r16, and
   <span class="icode">b</span> will be r17, then we can write this rather simply
   as a function even:

   <sim-avr text="'ldi r31, 136
out 61, r31  ; set SPL to 136
ldi r31, 19
out 62, r31  ; set SPH to 19

rjmp real_program_start

multiply:
push r18
push r19
ldi r18,0    ; counter = 0
ldi r19,0    ; since product is r31:r30 and we are going to add
             ; b to it, b should be two bytes also.
             ; We pick r19:r17

  </p><p><b>Debrief:</b> This is actually a somewhat horrendous algorithm
for multiplying two numbers.  For a start, it only takes two steps to
computer 2*255, but takes 255 steps to compute 255*2.  While 255 steps
is not so bad if we only have to do it every once in a while, there is
a more clever algorithm that we shall leave in an aside for the
curious.</p><div class="aside"><b>Aside: The proper way to multiply numbers by hand</b>
  <p>The trick is that we can very easily multiply numbers by 2: Just
  add a number to itself!  This even works for tow-register numbers:
  To multiply r29:r28 by 2, just do:

  <div class="code"><pre>add r28,r28
adc r29,r29</pre></div>

  So how does multiplying by 2 help us?  Let us think about writing
  <span class="icode">b</span> in binary: Maybe it is, say, 00100110 or
  2<sup>5</sup> + 2<sup>2</sup> + 2<sup>1</sup>.  Then to compute a*b,
  we only have to compute a*(2<sup>5</sup> + 2<sup>2</sup> +
  2<sup>1</sup>).  Using the distributive law, this means we only have
  to compute a*2, a*2*2, and a*2*2*2*2*2 and add them up.</p>
  
  <p>Put another way, this means we can do:
  <ol>
    <li>Store 0 in r31:r30.  This will be the answer by the end of the
    algorithm</li>
    <li>Store a in r29:r28</li>
    <li>For each bit of b, do the following:
    <ol>
      <li>If the bit of b is set, then add r29:r28 to r31:r30</li>
      <li>Multiply r29:r28 by 2</li>
    </ol>
    </li>
  </ol>
  
  OK, but how do we test if each bit of b is set?  This is where the
  AND operation will help us: We can "b AND 1" will be nonzero exactly when the first
  bit is set, "b AND 2" will be nonzero exactly when the second bit is
  set, "b AND 4" will be nonzero exactly when the third bit is set,
  and so on.  So we can keep another counter that we keep doubling and
  ANDing with b for this test.  </p>
