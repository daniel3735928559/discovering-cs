<q>True or false: Mobile phones and game consoles are both computers. </q>
<q>What four things is the computer capable of?</q>
<q>Define a computer.</q>
<q>For each of the steps 1-5 in the algorithm written below, mention which among the four capabilities of a computer are required (A step may require more than one capability):
<ol>
<li>Take a number from the user and call it n1.</li>
<li>Take another number from the user and call it n2.</li>
<li>Add n1 and n2. Save the sum in a memory location. We will call this memory location total.</li>
<li>Divide total  by 2. If you get 0 as a remainder, go to step v, else go to step vi.</li>
<li>Display “total is even” on the monitor.</li>
</ol></q>
<q><p>Write an algorithm to determine whether the result of A / B should be rounded up, down, or has no remainder, if the rules for rounding are to round up if the remainder is .5 or greater and round down if it is less than .5. </p>
<p>Assume you are not able to use the modulus operator (%) and that A > B.</p></q>
<q>What is an algorithm?</q>
<q>What is the difference between a fixed-program device and a
stored-program device?  Is your basic pocket calculator a fixed-program computer or a stored-program computer?</q>
<q>According to the text, the ENIAC was:
<ol><li>Turing Complete</li>
<li>a fixed program device</li>
<li>a stored program device</li>
<li>A and C</li>
<li>A and B</li>
<li>none of the above</li>
</ol></q>
<p>The following 4 problems refer to the 4-step square-root algorithm from this section:</p>
<q>(Calculator required) Apply the square-root algorithm to x = 9. Iterate through the 4 steps one time. Keep track of the current s-value by writing it down at the end of each step.</q>
<q>Design a list of steps similar to the square-root algorithm that computes A*B and stores the result in C, where A and B are positive integers. Assume that your hardware is only capable of adding, comparing (>, &lt;, >=, &lt;=, =), and storing.</q>
<q>Now verify that your algorithm works by testing the values A=2 and B=3. Iterate through the steps until completion. Keep track of your B and C values by writing them down at the end of each step. </q>
<q>Define the property Turing Complete.</q>
<q> What is the fundamental difference between the ABC and the ENIAC?</q>
<q>Why is the following sequence of steps not a valid computer algorithm?
<ol><li>Store 0 in a memory location, and call the memory location sum.</li>
<li>Add 1 to sum, and save the result back in sum.</li>
<li>If sum is large enough, go to step 4, else go to step 3.</li>
<li>Display sum on the console.</li>
<li>Stop</li></ol></q>
<q>True or false: Systems are more abstract than computers.</q>
<q>What is the difference between systems and computers?</q>
<q>Explain the difference between implementation and interface and give an example of both.</q>
<q>What is an abstraction?
<p>(An abstraction, not just abstraction in general)</p></q>
<q>Draw and explain all levels of abstraction. 
<p>In figures 1.3.1.1 and 1.3.1.2, what do the large arrows connecting the customer to WaffleCo represent?</p></q>
<q>Describe the interface of a compiler.  </q>
<q> What are the benefits of black-boxing?</q>
<q>Differentiate between the ISA and the microarchitecture.</q>
<q>Explain all the layers in a computer.</q>
<q> <p>What level of abstraction hides the details of the statements which follow? For example, the abstraction level of logic gates allows engineers not to think in terms of transistors. </p>
<ol><li><p>A bunch of loads into memory, stores from memory, arithmetic computational instructions, and a branching instruction at the ISA level, is all contained in one single Python “if” statement.
		</p></li>
<li><p>A stored program computer consists of a Central Processing unit, I/O devices, and memory.</p></li>
<li>An ALU consists of loads of AND and OR gates.</li>
<li>A very common type of  2-input NAND gate consists of 4 transistors.</li>
</ol></q>
<q>List and explain the significance of the different parts of the ISA.</q>
<q>Explain the difference between syntax and semantics.</q>
<q>Explain algorithmic complexity and how trade-offs are involved in choosing an algorithm.</q>
<q>Complexity accounts for:<ol>
<li>degree of difficulty of math used in algorithm</li>
<li>memory used</li>
<li>time taken to write the algorithm</li>
<li>time to execute</li>
<li>b and d</li></ol></q>
<q>How are syntax errors and runtime errors similar and how do they differ?</q>
<q><p>According to the max(?, ?) function defined in this section, would the following incorrect usage be a syntax error or runtime error?  </p>
<p>max( 4 , “dog” )</p></q>
<q> What are programming languages and their syntax and semantics?</q>
<q> Explain the errors which might occur while programming.</q>
<q>Differentiate between high-level and low-level programming languages. Give examples of low-level languages.</q>
<q> Programming using a high-level language is much easier than using ISA instructions directly. But, what is a benefit in programming using ISA instructions directly?</q>
<q><p> In some programming language, to display the natural logarithm of any number n, this is what we need to write: print (log(n))</p>
<p>A group of students were assigned to display log(5).Three different students wrote:</p>
<ol><li>print (log(5))</li>
<li>print (log((5)</li>
<li>print (log(55))</li></ol>
<p>Which student got the right answer? What were the type of errors experienced by the  other two students?</p></q>
<q><p>True or false:</p>
<ol><li>If  I plan to change the type of transistors I was using, I would have to change my ISA.</li>
<li>If I plan to use a different programming language, I would have to develop a new ISA.</li>
<li>If I disallow some instructions from my ISA, some Python instructions may stop working.</li>
</ol></q>
<q>Companies tend to stick with very similar or the same ISA across generations of computers, even when there can be some benefit in performance if they changed it. Why do you think they do that?</q>
<q>What is a state machine?</q>
<q>Create a truth table for NOR, where the output is 0 when either of
the inputs is 1 and the output is 1 otherwise.</q>
<q>Create a state machine that uses binary inputs of 0 and 1 and looks for four consecutive 1s and outputs “Found four 1s” when this occurs. Use only 0 and 1 for inputs at each state and write outputs of states inside the state “bubble” when creating the diagram.</q>
<q>Use figure 1.5.1.1 to answer the following: Beginning in the
neutral state, which state will the cat be in after the following
sequence of inputs is applied?
<ol>
  <li>Ignore, ignore, ignore, pet, pet, pet</li>
  <li>Ignore, ignore, pet, pet, pet</li>
  <li>Feed, ignore, ignore, ignore, feed, ignore, ignore, pet</li>
</ol>
</q>
<q>What is an encoding and how is it used by computers?</q>
<q>What is a Turing Machine?</q>
<q>Explain how abstraction works in the search engine example,
specifying the individual components/teams involved.</q>
<q>All objects in a game are:
<ol><li>squares</li>
<li>circles</li>
<li>triangles</li></ol></q>
<q>What are the two distinct components involved with programming a
game and what are their main duties?</q>
<q>What are the two engines used in the software side of the game?</q>
<q>The decimal value 6 can be represented in binary as 0110, which is
shown in the table in section in 1.9.4. Using the procedure for
multiplying by 2 shown in figure 1.9.4.5, show and explain how 6*2 =
12 = 1100 in binary.</q>
<q>What are some sensors used in mobile phones?</q>
<q>What is noise, how does it affect phones, and explain how it is compensated for in phones, using both software and hardware input and calculation.</q>
<q>In section 1.5 we introduced the truth table for the AND gate. In
this section, we define an OR gate as one that turns on (output is 1)
if only input 1 is on, or if only input 2 is on, or if both are
on. Based on this description, fill in the truth table for the OR
gate: <p><table border = "1" style = "width:100%">
<tr>
<th>Input 1</th>
<th>Input 2</th>
<th>Output</th></tr>
<tr>
<td>0</td>
<td>0</td>
<td></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>0</td>
<td>1</td>
<td></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>1</td>
<td>0</td>
<td></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>1</td>
<td>1</td>
<td></td>
</tr>
</table></p>
</q>
<q>In this section, we define an XOR gate as one that turns on (output
is 1) if input 1 or input 2 is on, but not if both are on. Based on
this description, fill in the truth table for the XOR gate: <p><table
border = "1" style = "width:100%">
<tr>
<th>Input 1</th>
<th>Input 2</th>
<th>Output</th></tr>
<tr>
<td>0</td>
<td>0</td>
<td></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>0</td>
<td>1</td>
<td></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>1</td>
<td>0</td>
<td></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>1</td>
<td>1</td>
<td></td>
</tr>
</table></p>

<q>The XOR name is shorthand for "Exclusive OR". How does this name so
accurately represent the functionality of the XOR gate? (Hint: what
exactly is the difference between OR and XOR? What is "exclusive"
about the XOR functionality?)</q>
