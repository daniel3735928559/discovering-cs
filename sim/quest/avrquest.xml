<text>First things first, let's learn how to use this thing.  Observe
the code in the editor to the right.  <p>Press [run] to start running
the program.  While the program is running, the program cannot be
modified.  Press [step] (or use Shift+S) to advance through the
program.  Note how the variables change as you do so.</p><p>The
program will stop running either when you step through the last
instruction or when you press [end] (or use Shift+E), at which point
you can modify the program again.  </p><p>To make the step button take
more steps at once, enter a higher number in the box next to it.</p>
