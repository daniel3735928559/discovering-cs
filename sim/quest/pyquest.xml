the code in the editor to the right.  <p>Press [run] to start running
the program.  While the program is running, the program cannot be
modified.  Press [step] (or use Shift+S) to advance through the
program.  Note how the variables change as you do so.</p><p>The
program will stop running either when you step through the last

<q type="python" id="Variables">
  <program>x = 3+2
y = 1+x*(-1)
hello = (x+2*y)/y
x = x + 1
y = y - x</program>
  <text>Variables are like the computer's internal memory (which we've exposed for you to see).  Variables are how you store things.  To create one, simply write a line like <pre><i>name</i> = <i>value</i></pre>  The name can be any combination of letters and underscores.  The value can be any <b>expression</b>.  That is, any number, variable name, or some combination of numbers and variables using the four arithmetic operations and parentheses.</text>
</q>

<q type="python" id="Strings">
  <program>hello = "Hello!"
x = "\"Meow!\", they \\ exclaimed in unison"</program>
  <text>Expressions do not have to be numbers.  They can also be
  <b>strings</b>, which are the computer's way of storing text.  The
  symbols comprising text (letters, numbers, punctuation, and anything
  else) are called <b>characters</b>.  A string is any sequence of
  characters enclosed in double quotes, such as

  <pre>"Hello World!"</pre>

  Obviously, the characters inside the string cannot include the
  double-quote character: ".  To put a " into a string, precede it
  with a backslash like:

  <pre>\"</pre>

  This is called <b>escaping</b> the character.  There are certain
  characters where escaping them (i.e. preceding them with a
  backslash) gives them different meaning.  Normally, a " means "the
  end of the string".  But if you escape it, now it means "put a
  double quote character actually into the string.  Some other
  characters can be escaped as well.  For instance, if you escape the
  n character as in

  <pre>\n</pre>

  you get a line-break inserted into your string.

  <p>So now how do you put a backslash character itself into a string?
  Escape it!  <pre>\\</pre> Since expressions can be strings, we can
  store strings in variables just like we could store
  numbers.</p></text>
</q>

<q type="python" id="Output">
  <program>print("Hello")
x = -3
print(x+1)</program>
  <text>Output is how you would normally print text to the screen.  In
  this simulation, output goes to the "Output" column.  <p>To output
  something, use <pre>print(<i>expression</i>)</pre>.  This allows us
  to output any string or number that we could have stored in a
  variable.  It also allows us to output variables, as variables are
  also expessions.  See if you can use your knowledge of escape
  characters to output the following:

  <pre>XO_
XX_
O_O</pre>

  and

  <pre>  "The Assyrian came down \ like a wolf on the fold, 
And his cohorts were gleaming \ in purple and gold;"</pre>

and

  <pre>  00
   00
000000
   00
  00</pre>

<q type="python" id="Input">
  <program>import input
xyz = input.get_num("Enter a number")
hello = input.get_string("Enter a string")
print(2*xyz)
print(hello)</program>
  <text>Programs are boring if you cannot do anything with them.  Depending on whether you want a number or a string, there are ways to ask for user input and place it in a specified variable.  To get a number, do: <pre>input_num(<i>variable name</i>)</pre>  To get a string, do: <pre>input_string(<i>variable name</i>)</pre> Try to use this to make a simple calculator program that asks for two numbers and then outputs the product.</text>
</q>

<q type="python" id="If">
  <program>import input
print("Guess the value of 4*5-2-(4+37*4)")
guess = input.get_num("Enter a number")
if(guess != 4*5-2-(4+37*4)): 
   print("You LOSE!")
print("You guessed:")
print(guess)
if(guess == 4*5-2-(4+37*4)): 
   print("VICTORY!!!")</program>
  <text>All our programs so far execute every line from start to
  finish, in order, no exceptions.  Sometimes, we want to cordon off
  some lines and make them only execute under certain conditions.
  <p>To do this, first <b>indent</b> these lines--that is, put three
  additional spaces at the beginning of these lines.  Then add an "if"
  line just before them that looks like:

  <pre>if(<i>expression</i> <i>comparison</i> <i>expression</i>):</pre>

</p><p>The two expressions are, of course, expressions as we're used
to them, and the comparison is any of the following operators (with
the given meanings):

  <pre>== (is equal to)
!= (is not equal to)
&lt;  (is less than)
>  (is greater than)
&lt;= (is less than or equal to)
>= (is greater than or equal to)</pre>

 The whole block including the "if" line and all its indented lines is
 called an <b>if statement</b>.</p> <p>When the program gets to the
 "if" line, it will compare the two provided expressions
 appropriately.  If the comparison holds true, then the indented lines
 following the if statement will execute.  If the comparison does not
 hold true, then execution will proceed to the first line after the if
 statement that is not indented</p></text>

<q type="python" id="Nested if">
  <program>import input
niceness = input.get_num("Enter a number")
print("Guess the value of 4*5-2-(4+37*4)")
guess = input.get_num("Enter a number")
if(guess != 4*5-2-(4+37*4)): 
   if(niceness &lt; 5):
      print("You LOSE!")
   if(niceness > 5): 
      print("Sorry!  Better luck next time!")
if(guess == 4*5-2-(4+37*4)): 
   print("VICTORY!!!")</program>
  <text>Inside an if statement, it is possible to include further if
  statements.  For example, if we want to make sure we have enough
  bananas we do:

<pre>if(bananas > 6):
   print("YAY!")</pre>

  To make sure that we have both enough bananas and enough bongos, we
  want to first check the bananas.  If they are sufficient, then in
  that case we want to also test the bongos.  So we want the
  bongo-testing if statement inside the banana-testing one:

<pre>if(bananas > 6): 
   if(bongos > 5): 
      print("YAY!")</pre>

  This is called a <b>nested if statement</b>.  We can of course nest
  further if statements inside this one to our heart's content.</text>

<q type="python" id="Else">
  <program>import input
print("Guess the value of 4*5-2-(4+37*4)")
guess = input.get_num("Enter a number")
if(guess > 4*5-2-(4+37*4)): 
   print("Too big!")
else:
   if(guess &lt; 4*5-2-(4+37*4)): 
      print("Too small!")
   else: 
      print("VICTORY!!!")</program>
  <text>A problem in the previous program was 

<pre>if(niceness > 5): 
   print("You LOSE")
if(niceness > 5): 
   print("Sorry!")</pre>

But what happens if niceness is exactly 5?  We accidentally missed
this case.  <p>What we really wanted was to say "If niceness is less
than 5, be curt.  Otherwise, be tactful".  There is a programmatic
way of saying "otherwise" called "else".</p><p>Immediately
following the indented lines of an if statement, you may include the
line <pre>else:</pre> with the same level of indentation as the
corresponding if statement, and followed by further indented lines
that will be executed only if the comparison in the "if" line
failed.  So an easier way of doing the above is:

<pre>if(niceness > 5): 
   print("You LOSE")
else: 
   print("Sorry!")</pre>

<q type="python" id="While">
  <program>import input
print("Guess the value of 4*5-2-(4+37*4)")
guess = input.get_num("Enter a number")
while(guess != 4*5-2-(4+37*4)): 
   if(guess > 4*5-2-(4+37*4)): 
      print("Too big!")
   else:
      print("Too small!")
   guess = input.get_num("Enter a number")
print("VICTORY!!!")</program>
  <text>Similar to an "if" line is the "while" line: <pre>while(<i>expr comp expr</i>):</pre>  It is also followed by one or more indented lines.  An if statement will execute the indented lines once through if the comparison holds true and then will move on.  A while statement will execute the indented lines if the comparison holds true, and then when the indented lines are finished it will return to the comparison and check it again.  <p>If it still holds true, the indented lines will be run again.  And if the comparison is still true after they are done, they will be run yet again, and so on until the comparison stops being true.  </p></text>
